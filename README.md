Members: Rayhan Howlader and Riya Shrestha 

For this project, our task was to read in several books from the same genre and author to find the most common phrases. 

To accomplish that, the first task was to read the text and clean it to get rid of all the puntuations and spacings. 
Then to create a dictionary of words, find k (500) most used used words, and assigning them all unique ids. 
Next, the task was to create a list of the most common phrases of the most common words used in the book with the variation of one word. 
Finally, the last task was to then encode all the common words in the phrases with their unique ids and all non common words with 0, sort, and return phrases with frequency higher than 1 with its own unique id.

We used the first three Harry Potter books for this project and treated all words including proper nouns equally, creating a list of the most used common phrases.
