the rain falls in sheets across the yard  another pane of glass beyond our windows  would you like it warmer  mr  gill the house pings once  twice no     i say     it   s fine the way it is    thank you very much  the house says just like anybody else  the house likes to talk to somebody  i imagined this as a great feature  i   m an ergonomic architect  i designed it denny is asleep in his room  you   d think at fifteen  he   d be too old to take a nap  but he   s wiped out after soccer  carolyn threw denny   s football out today  the foam rubber football i gave him when he was four years old it was old  she said  falling apart  he didn   t want it any more  i thought  if he really doesn   t want the football  maybe he could say  i tried asking but right then  denny was off to soccer practice  then a study session then the game  now  he   s sleeping  this is what happens when they   re in high school carolyn says i should be proud  proud he   s such an athlete  and a scholar and i guess i   m a gentleman the rain comes down like liquid leaded glass the gardeners have taken the trash all the way to the curb once again it   s a very long way to the end of the driveway i return with half of denny   s football she must have taken shears to it  a lightning strike of rage flashes  if she were home right now      your body temperature is lower than normal  mr  gill  the house chimes in its chimey voice i   ve been out in the rain     i mutter would you like some soft  fluffy towels  the house asks  i want the other half of the football  i   ll glue it back together  but i smile and grunt an assent  to which the house responds outside  the rain sleets down  a thousand tiny sticks pattering on a thousand tin drums  nah  not drums  it   s just our solar panels denny was born with hlhs  that   s an acronym for hypoplastic left heart syndrome  hypoplastic left heart syndrome is universally fatal  if leftuntreated  even now  there are babies that do not survive  even with full  length clone dna therapy administered in utero when at five months of pregnancy  carolyn went for a high level ultrasound that determined denny had hlhs  it seemed like the most natural thing in the world to try gene therapy  the doctors explained how the heart healed itself as the baby grew it was raining that day pouring outside while we listened to the neonatal geneticist explain how the procedure worked  we were so lucky  she said  before gene therapy  babies like denny could only survive with full heart transplants she told us about a doctor that had tried baboon hearts to replace broken baby ones apparently  some parents aborted babies diagnosed with hlhs i   d never accept that     i said what     carolyn snapped  her hand over her swollen belly     you   d rather let my baby suffer    i guess i hadn   t thought of it that way the geneticist explained in the past  babies born with this heart defect were simply left to die  their hearts barely pumped blood  and they would just fade away        maybe that could be less humane than an abortion at least that was what we discussed on the way home it was a miracle that we had the gene therapy  and that denny was born whole  and totally healthy it was the best moment of my life the rain rattles the solar panels as i sort pictures on the computer denny in his baby swing  denny playing with blocks i should be working  but i can   t focus on the recreation center today there was one of him holding the fuzzy book he got from hisgrandmother  she was so frightened    my mother    when i told her aboutdenny   s heart problem  she didn   t understand gene therapy carolyn got on the phone and explained it to her  when denny wasborn perfectly healthy  i don   t think any of us gave it much more thought my mother and denny sat for hours  reading that little book  pat the bunny her favorite    she insisted on buying it  i have it in my study  in the rightdrawer of my desk at one past garage sale  it had been another item bound for thedumpster i put the half football with pat the bunny denny was about three when he learned to read i sorted those pictures  too they say a man   s not supposed to be interested in pictures mementos the man lives his life  and the woman saves it well  what they say is true and what happens are sometimes twodifferent things there was another book denny liked  stan the hotdog man  we readit over and over and one day  denny started talking about stan  it dawned on me thathe was reading carolyn  come here     i called she came running in from the kitchen  alarmed honey  i think he   s reading    her face changed     horse manure     she said no  really     i said denny then read a whole page of stan the hotdog man in his smallvoice  he beamed proudly up at me see     i said you   ve read it to him so many times  he   s memorized it     she said oh     i said it was some time later when i learned that by memorizing the book denny was  indeed  reading  by that time  he was in kindergarten i sorted some more of the pictures from later years  and lookedpensively out at the rain  denny was still sleeping i think i always hoped that my son would play football back before i met carolyn  i played ball  played all the way throughsophomore year in college  sidelined by a knee injury  i guess i was a prettygood running back  if a little bit underweight  the guys were all into steroidsback in those days  there was no such thing as gene augmentation  all wehad were good  old fashioned workouts and protein shakes and maybe a shot in the butt for guys that were really dedicated  orcrazy you could blow your heart out on steroids  they made you break outall over  gave you erectile dysfunction  made you crazy happened to a lot ofmy friends  it   s a good thing i figured out thattrap before i fell into it i guess i did try it a few times drops of rain dappled the window your heart rate has increased  mr  gill  the house chimed  your corebody temperature has dropped so turn up the heat     i told the house i had to say something  otherwise  it wouldn   t leave me alone i folded the blue ribbon neatly into my desk drawer  for mathexcellence  why they   d give a math prize to a kid in second grade wasbeyond me when denny hit second grade  his teacher pointed up that he wasreading like a pro  but having trouble with his figures i was never too good with math     i told her  wasn   t that great inreading  either  but i didn   t feel compelled to share you might want to look into some tutoring     she said he   s in second grade     i said carolyn hushed me     how far is he behind     she asked behind     the teacher asked     oh  no    he   s not behind    well  there   s no reason to worry     i said     he   ll pick it up    his times tables     carolyn said     next year he   s got to learn thetimes tables    we don   t do it that way any more  mrs  gill  each child is testedindividually against his or her own standards    i didn   t precisely follow how there could be enough time to setindividual standards seeing as the kid had just started second grade how far is he behind     carolyn asked again he   s not behind     the teacher said  a stubborn tone creeping into hervoice     denny is so bright  i   m sure you   d agree with me that he could dobetter if he applied himself  that   s all i   m trying to say    maybe he just wants to play outside     i said hush     carolyn said     gary and i both agree that denny is bright and he   s got plenty of motivation    well     the teacher said smiling     why don   t you try that tutoringservice  or a math buddy    a math buddy was like an english buddy  or a foreign languagebuddy  it was a small  silver  pain in the ass robot that could also vacuumthe floor  they were notorious for tripping guys foolish enough to buy themfor their kids  a guy in cleveland broke his neck that way i was going to be damned if i   d get one  i would have rather gottendenny another football on the way out to the car  carolyn looked up at me  concernwrinkling her forehead     he   s falling behind in math     she whispered you don   t have to whisper     i told her     nobody can hear  besides the teacher said he   s not behind  we can encourage him    encourage him     carolyn snapped     he can do better  and he will    well  do you think we should try a tutor     i asked  the thought oflocking denny inside with some greasy haired high school math geek mademe cringe  but even that was a more appealing choice than bringing agibbering  tortoise like    math buddy    into the house  so it could trip me onthe stairs and turn me into a paraplegic no     carolyn said     not a tutor    i felt relieved have you heard about the new gene therapy     she asked     it   s justlike what they did for denny   s heart defect  only it can strengthen a child   sbrain power  i was reading all about it yesterday    oh     i said  i had pretty favorable memories of how they   d fixeddenny   s heart     how does that work    maybe it   s like what they did before  only they inject the newgenetic material into someone   s brain  then it makes a few changes and theperson gets smarter    oh     i said  i didn   t like the thought of anybody injecting anythinginto denny   s brain  but i   d learned it was best not to interrupt carolyn whenshe was thinking like this  frankly  it was almost always better just to waitthings out  half the time she forgot about this stuff and never mentioned itagain if you   re concerned about your son   s logical and mathematicalabilities  i don   t think you   ve got much to worry about with denny     dr mandel said     he   s a bright  normal boy    but his teacher says he   s falling behind in math     carolyn said can   t we do something    i   d recommend a math buddy     the doctor said     my own daughterhas one  she   s about denny   s age  she used to hate math  and now she lovesit    doesn   t that thing get in your way     i asked    about the mathbuddy thing     the doctor said  looking puzzled     oh     he said  chuckling yeah  it did trip me up once  i fell right off the deck into the pool    there   s something i don   t like about those little robots     i said     theteacher also suggested a tutor    a wise choice     the doctor said  he started to check his personalassistant  a sure sign our time was up  i started to rise  but carolyn put herhand on my arm wait     she said     can you explain how the procedure works doctor    he paused  i suddenly understood that he was one of those guys whonever missed a chance to wow others with his special  technical knowledge well     he said  smiling     years ago  we discovered that viruses couldbe effective transports to load different types of dna into human    or anyother type    of brains  now we   ve identified a specific enzyme or cocktailof enzymes that enhances almost every type of brain function  we load theenzymes into a virus  which then transcribes the dna  and delivers thedesired changes to what we once thought were    unchangeable    brain cells i   m sure you   ve heard of people building up their    extra sensoryperception       carolyn and i nodded  we   d seen a show about wild eyed lunaticsbending iron and starting fires at a distance the night before it   s like an infection     dr  mandel said     but it   s one that mostpeople wouldn   t mind catching    like a cold     carolyn asked exactly     dr  mandel said     you do understand  only in this case the subject catches the cold in their cerebral cortex  and as healing occurs  sodo changes for the better    wow     carolyn said i   m not sure about this     i said shhh     she hushed how old is your son     the doctor asked seven     carolyn said ah  the perfect age  look       he said  leaning across his shinytitanium desk    everybody who was anybody had one of those a few yearsback      it   s not cheap  but you could make your son into a math genius ifyou wanted  he wouldn   t feel a thing  and a few days later  his abilitieswould manifest  they   d grow day by day    i don   t know     i said  it sounded like mad scientist stuff to me weren   t they trying these techniques on psychotic murderers  if this was sosafe and healthy  i figured we would have heard about it in other areasbeside criminal rehabilitation and iron bending firestarters people are doing it all the time     dr  mandel said     you just don   thear about it on the newslinks because improving kids    test scores isn   tnearly as big a story as turning a mass murderer into mother teresa    carolyn squeezed my hand under the table     doctor  we   d like to try    she said i suppose we could        dr  mandel said  voice slightly uncertain is this necess      carolyn cut me short     i know he can benefit     she said     i don   t thinkwe mentioned it earlier  but denny received gene therapy before he wasborn  to cure a congenital heart defect    oh     the doctor said     in that case  he   s pre qualified  be sure to fillout all the forms  you two  we   re conducting multi treatment longitudinalstudies and your son is an ideal candidate    so  denny got the blue ribbon in math he got so into math that he stayed inside almost all the time  hehardly wanted to play with his friends any more  we were supposed to startpony league football but denny didn   t want to play  he didn   t want to try for t ball either the only thing he   d talk about was math one day  carolyn pointed out that denny was getting a little chunky he was size eight last month     she said     now i   ve got to buy thenext size up    so  my mom told me i grew three sizes and four inches onesummer    your mom said all kinds of things     carolyn said mom had passed last spring  we used to joke about her seeing dennythrough high school  it wasn   t meant to be could you give it a rest  carolyn     my wife thought that sevenmonths was long enough  for mourning she forged ahead     denny   s getting fat  gary  we can   t let him getoverweight    so  we   ll put him on a diet     i said  i   d been a little chunky when iwas his age  when my mom found out how much time i could waste playingvideo games  she ripped the whole console out of the wall  it was the cold turkey video game withdrawal method  i lost the weight we tried a diet  but denny was too young to understand why hecouldn t eat everything he liked  i wasn   t surprised when a couple offrustrating weeks later  carolyn told me that she   d called dr  mandel there was of course a gene therapy    the most popular one of all    todeal with unwanted weight gain  this time  the virus carrying altereddna helped to increase some of the hormones in the brain that controlledappetite and metabolism voila  a thin kid that was denny   s third treatment the rain is imploding on the roof  it   s almost in my head turn up the heat     i scream the house complies  if i didn   t know better  i   d almost think that thehouse was sulking after the obesity treatment  denny started getting into soccer  anddiscovered his talent for art by thirteen  denny was dr  mandel   s best patient  he had even beenfeatured on the cover of parenting with two other kids that had been helpedby dr  mandel   s gene practice  it wasn   t exactly as if gene therapy wascutting edge any more  dr  mandel was known for his    boutique    practice that meant that he helped parents with money and fine edged concernsabout their children   s growth and well being no one really took the dire warnings of the early part of themillennium seriously creating a    master race    and so on  well  heck  if a person could get alittle bit better in some way  and it wasn   t hurting them or anybody else  howdid that qualify as a    master race     people without genetic improvementswere never looked down upon sure  it was a generational thing  i mean  there were some skintherapies for people my age and carolyn   s age  and they had learned how torejuvenate most of the vital organs  when i was young  it was a big deal foranybody to make it to age      these days  you had to hit     and lookreally good to get your picture on the newslinks it was the kids that benefited  if somebody would have told me backin the day that a pugsley kid could turn into a hunk in a matter of weeks  or akid with no chin could suddenly acquire a nice  square one without surgery  iwould have laughed out loud  you were what you were born to be up until he was nine or ten  denny   s eyes were kind of a hazel color now they were piercing  bright blue  the girls went crazy over his eyes  i mean  the kid was a good looking fifteen  but   the house chimed  somebody was calling gary here     i answered is denny home     came a petite  snippy little voice yes  but he   s sleeping  tired out after his game     i didn   t share thathe   d had yet another treatment    this one to deal with a few pimples  of allthings  kids slept a lot after a treatment  body change and metabolicreadjustment  supposedly  dr  mandel likened it to    growing pains    oh  well  like we were supposed to be       studying       for chemistrytonight     the little voice said  after a moment   s pause  she added     this iscandy    i thought you were apple     i said  she sounded like the girl dennyhad introduced me to named    apple     apple was a cheerleader  and   no  i   m candy     she said vehemently     i don   t see how you couldconfuse us  apple is completely shallow and self centered and she can   t passmath  i   m the captain of the debate team    oh     i said  of course she was debate team captain     my mistake apple calls a lot    oh     candy said     i see    denny hardly ever takes her calls     i said  this was utterly untrue but for some reason  i enjoyed the thought of the little white lie that wasinvolved oh     she said  voice brightening     well  just tell denny that i called thank you  mr  gill     and she broke the connection so i went upstairs hey     i said  waking denny     a girl called    denny rose  shaking sleep out of his eyes     yeah  who was it  dad    apple     i said     wait    no  candy    candy     denny said  smiling slyly     she likes me  i think    she   s the jealous type too     i said     what are you doing to attract allthese girls  denny    denny scooted up in bed and swung his legs to the floor  he startedrubbing his shoulder     hurt it a little bit in the game     he said how   d it go    not bad     he said     we won by two goals  i got the last goal    of course you did  i thought  i hadn   t gone to the game  somehow  ijust hadn   t wanted to  it was raining  i said it was crazy to play soccer in therain  watching soccer in the rain was even crazier i couldn   t put my finger on the real reason i hadn   t gone to the game carolyn was at work  of course  she had a fulfilling  demanding job atthe local art museum  she put together their brochures and maintained theirweb presence  everybody says what artistic talent she has  it   s reallyamazing how denny has the same abilities    maybe even moreso  paintings drawings  vector art    denny does it all  he would be taking sculpture  if itdidn   t conflict with soccer practice denny got up and started to strip off his clothes  he was only fifteen but his chest and biceps were more muscular than mine  not just at thatage    now he sprinted into his bathroom and called for the house to turn on theshower did you order more after shave  dad     he called yeah     i said     yesterday    oh  right     denny said     it   s all full now    i can see it    of course i ordered after shave  when you work from home  all thoselittle chores seem to fall on you  tell the house what to cook for dinner  tellit to keep the different meals ready at different times for everyone   sschedule  see to it the laundry schedule isn   t too full and somebody   namely denny    isn   t going to have to run to a soccer game and play in adirty jersey  make sure all the plants are watered and trimmed and the rug isvacuumed and the floor polished and there are no lights out and there   hey dad  what should i do about candy     denny asked from theshower do about what    she likes me  dad  i like her fine as a friend  but i don   t want to getserious  she   s just not      what   s wrong with her    nothing     denny said well  if there   s nothing wrong with her  why don   t you like her     i knew perfectly well what he meant  but i was just playing with his mind i mean like  dad  as in       you know         you   re supposed to be the genius     i said     i don   t know  so explainit to me    i don   t know what i expected to hear     she   s homely  dad     or     shecomes on too strong     or  maybe     she   s pretty nerdy    she   s a mundane  dad     denny said     i just can   t get interested in agirl who   s never had any type of modifications    i said     oh    i sat on the bed  i think it was the way he said it denny came out of the shower  a towel wrapped around his adonis like frame     dad  you know how it is     he said yeah     i said i mean  look at apple  she might not be that smart  but she   s got agreat body  she does a five minute mile  and her nails are perfect  i knowher hair   s not real  but what does that matter  it looks great    apple   s a nice girl     i said a long time ago when denny was a baby  my mother came over andwe spent the whole day playing  building towers of blocks  reading books setting up paper and finger paints on the kitchen table  she baked cookies i watched my son and my mother playing together  his hair was lightbrown and wispy over his hazel eyes  maybe he looked like an old  baldingfat guy  but he was just a baby  there was a funny little cleft in his chin  hewas clumsy  we worked with him to use his right hand  then his left  justletting him experiment  she grabbed his outstretched hands in hers and liftedhim up  he giggled and stood and toddled  then soon sat back down he was only nine months even a genetically modified baby can   t walk at nine months and it comes to me why i didn   t go to the game i looked in denny   s eyes a long while  bright blue  they were  there   sbeen nobody with blue eyes in my family for a long time  maybe there neverwere  i can   t say those were carolyn   s eyes  either  she has muddy browneyes  and hates them denny started to laugh  feeling uncomfortable     hey  dad  what areyou looking at me like that for    i can   t reply i   m just    you know        i say  finally  i look over at denny   sartwork at the trophies for soccer  math ribbons  his poster  running for classpresident last year yeah  he won your mom threw your little kid football out this morning     i said what football     denny asked it was no big deal  i guess  i really didn   t know how to explain i heard him on the phone after dinner talking up that apple yeah  baby  i know it   s hard  but everyone   s parents are pretty muchmundanes  you should see my dad    it wasn   t like i hadn   t had my own rough spots with my dad  i wantedto run in and grab the vox away from denny  yell  tell her to respect herparents  tell him denny never knew my father  carolyn   s dad was an old fart whopainted bowls of fruit and sad eyed clowns he wasn   t a bad guy  he was just kind of       distant there was no way to make denny comprehend that my dad had beena great guy  i mean  i hated dad when he grounded me  i hated him when hetook my car away  i hated him when he flushed my sad little pot stash downthe can he taught me responsibility  he taught me what it meant to be a man a mundane hush my feet  i told the house much later that night  the house coulddo that  you know  make it quiet to walk  or very noisy  only theadministrator could tell it to do that  i know a lot of parents that use thisfeature i was sleeping in my study again  no  i was lying on the couch in thestudy  pretending to sleep it was easier  carolyn always has some book she   s reading or somework she   s going over and that light in my eyes drives me crazy i was turning the whole thing over in my mind all the little treatments  yeah  it was right to fix denny   s heart we had to fix denny   s heart denny was the only son carolyn and i were ever going to have i used  back in the day  you know  stacking  i was juiced up all the time i thought it made me more of a man they said it was a minor miracle that carolyn had gotten pregnant since i had a sperm count of about    three million particles per ml  andafter that  it went down even more  they call that sterile she could have left me  maybe if i had been in her shoes  i wouldhave she could have had a lot more kids with a healthy man but this was our son  this was denny one time  my dad was watching me at football practice  i caught aright screen pass we   d been practicing a long time and raced away  my legswere wings  the scrimmagers hurled themselves at me in slow motion  i wasflying  the wind whipping through the bars of my helmet  nobody couldtouch me my dad had this look on his face when he ran out on the field afterthat scrimmage we didn   t need to say too much  in fact  we didn   t say anything i was his son  and he was my dad then it started to rain  and we headed for our car i wandered into the kitchen  still remembering hey house  i   m going to make a sandwich     i whispered     i want touse the last of that good bread    do you want me to slice it     the house asked no     i said     you know i cut it myself    that   s right     the house said  it put the bread and knife out on thecounter mustard    yes    lettuce    no  just bologna    very good     the house said     low fat  high protein    right  house     i said     thanks    i cut the bread for the sandwich  put mustard on the bread  slappeddown the meat  slapped the whole thing together and stuffed it in my mouth then i started upstairs on quiet feet don   t forget to put your knife in the dishwasher     the house said to some questions  house did not require an immediate answer in terms of his eyes  they were blue a tear rolls down my mundane cheek his chest moves slowly  up and down  his breathing soft  like a cat denny stirs  moans slightly so they dream but what dreams come  i can never know there was no such face  ever  not in my house  not in my line  noneof my father   s strength  none of my mother   s cleft chin  none of us wereever so broad shouldered none of us were any good at math we were good with people  we were fast runners  me and dad denny   s a fast runner  too  but different one time i visited dad in the care home  premature alzheimers  theysaid  it was the last time he   d know my face  be able to say my name carolyn and i are having a baby     i told him     it   s going to be a littleboy    he took my hand i   m so glad  son     he said  his brown eyes warm and lucid  knowingme and what i said i wonder what it will feel like when i   m an old man  denny won   tcome i can   t imagine him ever telling me he   s going to have a son i dream what it will feel like to look into those ice blue  strange eyes just one stroke  quick  hard down into his changed heart  the heart of a perfect stranger denny turns and sighs like a vision  i see my dad   s face  he speaks why did you lose us  gary  your mom    me  for this he taught me what it was to be a man outside  the rain falls  it   s tapping on the roof like a hundred little catsrunning up and down i listen then i turn and go on my quiet feet back down the stairs outside  the rain is a cold curtain of ice knifing my face  i look up into the clear  black sky  no stars  nothing  pines shadowed against themidnight fog i know if i just look hard enough  i   ll find the other half of thefootball let the sky darken like soot  let the wind gather let it rain
