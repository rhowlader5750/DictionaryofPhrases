 chapter one the boy who lived m r and mrs dursley of number four privet drive were proud to say that they were perfectly normal thank you very much they were the last people youd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious because they just didnt hold with such nonsense mr dursley was the director of a firm called grunnings which made drills he was a big beefy man with hardly any neck although he did have a very large mustache mrs dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences spying on the neighbors the dursleys had a small son called dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere the dursleys had everything they wanted but they also had a secret and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it 1 chapter one they didnt think they could bear it if anyone found out about the potters mrs potter was mrs dursleys sister but they hadnt met for several years in fact mrs dursley pretended she didnt have a sister because her sister and her goodfornothing husband were as undursleyish as it was possible to be the dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the potters arrived in the street the dursleys knew that the potters had a small son too but they had never even seen him this boy was another good reason for keeping the potters away they didnt want dudley mixing with a child like that when mr and mrs dursley woke up on the dull gray tuesday our story starts there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country mr dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and mrs dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming dudley into his high chair none of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the window at half past eight mr dursley picked up his briefcase pecked mrs dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss dudley goodbye but missed because dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls little tyke chortled mr dursley as he left the house he got into his car and backed out of number fours drive it was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar a cat reading a map for a second mr dursley didnt realize what he had seen then he jerked his head around to look again there was a tabby cat standing on the corner 2 the boy who lived of privet drive but there wasnt a map in sight what could he have been thinking of it must have been a trick of the light mr dursley blinked and stared at the cat it stared back as mr dursley drove around the corner and up the road he watched the cat in his mirror it was now reading the sign that said privet drive no looking at the sign cats couldnt read maps or signs mr dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind as he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day but on the edge of town drills were driven out of his mind by something else as he sat in the usual morning traffic jam he couldnt help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about people in cloaks mr dursley couldnt bear people who dressed in funny clothes the getups you saw on young people he supposed this was some stupid new fashion he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by they were whispering excitedly together mr dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them werent young at all why that man had to be older than he was and wearing an emeraldgreen cloak the nerve of him but then it struck mr dursley that this was probably some silly stunt these people were obviously collecting for something yes that would be it the traffic moved on and a few minutes later mr dursley arrived in the grunnings parking lot his mind back on drills mr dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor if he hadnt he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning he didnt see the owls swoop 3 chapter one ing past in broad daylight though people down in the street did they pointed and gazed openmouthed as owl after owl sped overhead most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime mr dursley however had a perfectly normal owlfree morning he yelled at five different people he made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more he was in a very good mood until lunchtime when he thought hed stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery hed forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the bakers he eyed them angrily as he passed he didnt know why but they made him uneasy this bunch were whispering excitedly too and he couldnt see a single collecting tin it was on his way back past them clutching a large doughnut in a bag that he caught a few words of what they were saying the potters thats right thats what i heard yes their son harry mr dursley stopped dead fear flooded him he looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them but thought better of it he dashed back across the road hurried up to his office snapped at his secretary not to disturb him seized his telephone and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind he put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache thinking no he was being stupid potter wasnt such an unusual name he was sure there were lots of people called potter who had a son called harry come to think of it he wasnt even sure his nephew was called harry hed never even seen the boy it 4 the boy who lived might have been harvey or harold there was no point in worrying mrs dursley she always got so upset at any mention of her sister he didnt blame her if hed had a sister like that but all the same those people in cloaks he found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five oclock he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door sorry he grunted as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell it was a few seconds before mr dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak he didnt seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground on the contrary his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare dont be sorry my dear sir for nothing could upset me today rejoice for youknowwho has gone at last even muggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy happy day and the old man hugged mr dursley around the middle and walked off mr dursley stood rooted to the spot he had been hugged by a complete stranger he also thought he had been called a muggle whatever that was he was rattled he hurried to his car and set off for home hoping he was imagining things which he had never hoped before because he didnt approve of imagination as he pulled into the driveway of number four the first thing he saw and it didnt improve his mood was the tabby cat hed spotted that morning it was now sitting on his garden wall he was sure it was the same one it had the same markings around its eyes shoo said mr dursley loudly 5 chapter one the cat didnt move it just gave him a stern look was this normal cat behavior mr dursley wondered trying to pull himself together he let himself into the house he was still determined not to mention anything to his wife mrs dursley had had a nice normal day she told him over dinner all about mrs next doors problems with her daughter and how dudley had learned a new word wont mr dursley tried to act normally when dudley had been put to bed he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news and finally birdwatchers everywhere have reported that the nations owls have been behaving very unusually today although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern the newscaster allowed himself a grin most mysterious and now over to jim mcguffin with the weather going to be any more showers of owls tonight jim well ted said the weatherman i dont know about that but its not only the owls that have been acting oddly today viewers as far apart as kent yorkshire and dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain i promised yesterday theyve had a downpour of shooting stars perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early its not until next week folks but i can promise a wet night tonight mr dursley sat frozen in his armchair shooting stars all over britain owls flying by daylight mysterious people in cloaks all over the place and a whisper a whisper about the potters 6 the boy who lived mrs dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea it was no good hed have to say something to her he cleared his throat nervously er petunia dear you havent heard from your sister lately have you as he had expected mrs dursley looked shocked and angry after all they normally pretended she didnt have a sister no she said sharply why funny stuff on the news mr dursley mumbled owls shooting stars and there were a lot of funnylooking people in town today so snapped mrs dursley well i just thought maybe it was something to do with you know her crowd mrs dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips mr dursley wondered whether he dared tell her hed heard the name potter he decided he didnt dare instead he said as casually as he could their son hed be about dudleys age now wouldnt he i suppose so said mrs dursley stiffly whats his name again howard isnt it harry nasty common name if you ask me oh yes said mr dursley his heart sinking horribly yes i quite agree he didnt say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed while mrs dursley was in the bathroom mr dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden the cat was still there it was staring down privet drive as though it were waiting for something was he imagining things could all this have anything to do 7 chapter one with the potters if it did if it got out that they were related to a pair of well he didnt think he could bear it the dursleys got into bed mrs dursley fell asleep quickly but mr dursley lay awake turning it all over in his mind his last comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the potters were involved there was no reason for them to come near him and mrs dursley the potters knew very well what he and petunia thought about them and their kind he couldnt see how he and petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on he yawned and turned over it couldnt affect them how very wrong he was mr dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness it was sitting as still as a statue its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of privet drive it didnt so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street nor when two owls swooped overhead in fact it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all a man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching appeared so suddenly and silently youd have thought hed just popped out of the ground the cats tail twitched and its eyes narrowed nothing like this man had ever been seen on privet drive he was tall thin and very old judging by the silver of his hair and beard which were both long enough to tuck into his belt he was wearing long robes a purple cloak that swept the ground and highheeled buckled boots his blue eyes were light bright and sparkling behind halfmoon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked as though it had been broken at least twice this mans name was albus dumbledore 8 the boy who lived albus dumbledore didnt seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome he was busy rummaging in his cloak looking for something but he did seem to realize he was being watched because he looked up suddenly at the cat which was still staring at him from the other end of the street for some reason the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him he chuckled and muttered i should have known he found what he was looking for in his inside pocket it seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter he flicked it open held it up in the air and clicked it the nearest street lamp went out with a little pop he clicked it again the next lamp flickered into darkness twelve times he clicked the putouter until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance which were the eyes of the cat watching him if anyone looked out of their window now even beadyeyed mrs dursley they wouldnt be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement dumbledore slipped the putouter back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four where he sat down on the wall next to the cat he didnt look at it but after a moment he spoke to it fancy seeing you here professor mcgonagall he turned to smile at the tabby but it had gone instead he was smiling at a rather severelooking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes she too was wearing a cloak an emerald one her black hair was drawn into a tight bun she looked distinctly ruffled how did you know it was me she asked my dear professor ive never seen a cat sit so stiffly 9 chapter one youd be stiff if youd been sitting on a brick wall all day said professor mcgonagall all day when you could have been celebrating i must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here professor mcgonagall sniffed angrily oh yes everyones celebrating all right she said impatiently youd think theyd be a bit more careful but no even the muggles have noticed somethings going on it was on their news she jerked her head back at the dursleys dark livingroom window i heard it flocks of owls shooting stars well theyre not completely stupid they were bound to notice something shooting stars down in kent ill bet that was dedalus diggle he never had much sense you cant blame them said dumbledore gently weve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years i know that said professor mcgonagall irritably but thats no reason to lose our heads people are being downright careless out on the streets in broad daylight not even dressed in muggle clothes swapping rumors she threw a sharp sideways glance at dumbledore here as though hoping he was going to tell her something but he didnt so she went on a fine thing it would be if on the very day youknowwho seems to have disappeared at last the muggles found out about us all i suppose he really has gone dumbledore it certainly seems so said dumbledore we have much to be thankful for would you care for a lemon drop a what a lemon drop theyre a kind of muggle sweet im rather fond of 10 the boy who lived no thank you said professor mcgonagall coldly as though she didnt think this was the moment for lemon drops as i say even if youknowwho has gone my dear professor surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name all this youknowwho nonsense for eleven years i have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name voldemort professor mcgonagall flinched but dumbledore who was unsticking two lemon drops seemed not to notice it all gets so confusing if we keep saying youknowwho i have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying voldemorts name i know you havent said professor mcgonagall sounding half exasperated half admiring but youre different everyone knows youre the only one youknow oh all right voldemort was frightened of you flatter me said dumbledore calmly voldemort had powers i will never have only because youre too well noble to use them its lucky its dark i havent blushed so much since madam pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs professor mcgonagall shot a sharp look at dumbledore and said the owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around you know what everyones saying about why hes disappeared about what finally stopped him it seemed that professor mcgonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss the real reason she had been waiting on a cold hard wall all day for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now it was plain that whatever everyone was saying she was not going 11 chapter one to believe it until dumbledore told her it was true dumbledore however was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer what theyre saying she pressed on is that last night voldemort turned up in godrics hollow he went to find the potters the rumor is that lily and james potter are are that theyre dead dumbledore bowed his head professor mcgonagall gasped lily and james i cant believe it i didnt want to believe it oh albus dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder i know i know he said heavily professor mcgonagalls voice trembled as she went on thats not all theyre saying he tried to kill the potters son harry but he couldnt he couldnt kill that little boy no one knows why or how but theyre saying that when he couldnt kill harry potter voldemorts power somehow broke and thats why hes gone dumbledore nodded glumly its its true faltered professor mcgonagall after all hes done all the people hes killed he couldnt kill a little boy its just astounding of all the things to stop him but how in the name of heaven did harry survive we can only guess said dumbledore we may never know professor mcgonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it it was a very odd watch it had twelve hands but no numbers instead little planets were moving around the edge it must have 12 the boy who lived made sense to dumbledore though because he put it back in his pocket and said hagrids late i suppose it was he who told you id be here by the way yes said professor mcgonagall and i dont suppose youre going to tell me why youre here of all places ive come to bring harry to his aunt and uncle theyre the only family he has left now you dont mean you cant mean the people who live here cried professor mcgonagall jumping to her feet and pointing at number four dumbledore you cant ive been watching them all day you couldnt find two people who are less like us and theyve got this son i saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street screaming for sweets harry potter come and live here its the best place for him said dumbledore firmly his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when hes older ive written them a letter a letter repeated professor mcgonagall faintly sitting back down on the wall really dumbledore you think you can explain all this in a letter these people will never understand him hell be famous a legend i wouldnt be surprised if today was known as harry potter day in the future there will be books written about harry every child in our world will know his name exactly said dumbledore looking very seriously over the top of his halfmoon glasses it would be enough to turn any boys head famous before he can walk and talk famous for something he wont even remember cant you see how much better off hell be growing up away from all that until hes ready to take it professor mcgonagall opened her mouth changed her mind 13 chapter one swallowed and then said yes yes youre right of course but how is the boy getting here dumbledore she eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding harry underneath it hagrids bringing him you think it wise to trust hagrid with something as important as this i would trust hagrid with my life said dumbledore im not saying his heart isnt in the right place said professor mcgonagall grudgingly but you cant pretend hes not careless he does tend to what was that a low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them it grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them if the motorcycle was huge it was nothing to the man sitting astride it he was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide he looked simply too big to be allowed and so wild long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face he had hands the size of trash can lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins in his vast muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets hagrid said dumbledore sounding relieved at last and where did you get that motorcycle borrowed it professor dumbledore sir said the giant climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke young sirius black lent it to me ive got him sir 14 the boy who lived no problems were there no sir house was almost destroyed but i got him out all right before the muggles started swarmin around he fell asleep as we was flyin over bristol dumbledore and professor mcgonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets inside just visible was a baby boy fast asleep under a tuft of jetblack hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut like a bolt of lightning is that where whispered professor mcgonagall yes said dumbledore hell have that scar forever couldnt you do something about it dumbledore even if i could i wouldnt scars can come in handy i have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the london underground well give him here hagrid wed better get this over with dumbledore took harry in his arms and turned toward the dursleys house could i could i say goodbye to him sir asked hagrid he bent his great shaggy head over harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy whiskery kiss then suddenly hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog shhh hissed professor mcgonagall youll wake the muggles sssorry sobbed hagrid taking out a large spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it but i cccant stand it lily an james dead an poor little harry off ter live with muggles yes yes its all very sad but get a grip on yourself hagrid or well be found professor mcgonagall whispered patting hagrid 15 chapter one gingerly on the arm as dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door he laid harry gently on the doorstep took a letter out of his cloak tucked it inside harrys blankets and then came back to the other two for a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle hagrids shoulders shook professor mcgonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that usually shone from dumbledores eyes seemed to have gone out well said dumbledore finally thats that weve no business staying here we may as well go and join the celebrations yeah said hagrid in a very muffled voice id best get this bike away gnight professor mcgonagall professor dumbledore sir wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night i shall see you soon i expect professor mcgonagall said dumbledore nodding to her professor mcgonagall blew her nose in reply dumbledore turned and walked back down the street on the corner he stopped and took out the silver putouter he clicked it once and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that privet drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street he could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four good luck harry he murmured he turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak he was gone 16 the boy who lived a breeze ruffled the neat hedges of privet drive which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen harry potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up one small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on not knowing he was special not knowing he was famous not knowing he would be woken in a few hours time by mrs dursleys scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin dudley he couldnt know that at this very moment people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices to harry potter the boy who lived 17 chapter two the vanishing glass n early ten years had passed since the dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step but privet drive had hardly changed at all the sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the dursleys front door it crept into their living room which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when mr dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed ten years ago there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing differentcolored bonnets but dudley dursley was no longer a baby and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle on a carousel at the fair playing a computer game with his father being hugged and kissed by his mother the room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house too 18 the vanishing glass yet harry potter was still there asleep at the moment but not for long his aunt petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day up get up now harry woke with a start his aunt rapped on the door again up she screeched harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove he rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having it had been a good one there had been a flying motorcycle in it he had a funny feeling hed had the same dream before his aunt was back outside the door are you up yet she demanded nearly said harry well get a move on i want you to look after the bacon and dont you dare let it burn i want everything perfect on duddys birthday harry groaned what did you say his aunt snapped through the door nothing nothing dudleys birthday how could he have forgotten harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks he found a pair under his bed and after pulling a spider off one of them put them on harry was used to spiders because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them and that was where he slept when he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen the table was almost hidden beneath all dudleys birthday presents it looked as though dudley had gotten the new computer he 19 chapter two wanted not to mention the second television and the racing bike exactly why dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to harry as dudley was very fat and hated exercise unless of course it involved punching somebody dudleys favorite punching bag was harry but he couldnt often catch him harry didnt look it but he was very fast perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard but harry had always been small and skinny for his age he looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of dudleys and dudley was about four times bigger than he was harry had a thin face knobbly knees black hair and bright green eyes he wore round glasses held together with a lot of scotch tape because of all the times dudley had punched him on the nose the only thing harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning he had had it as long as he could remember and the first question he could ever remember asking his aunt petunia was how he had gotten it in the car crash when your parents died she had said and dont ask questions dont ask questions that was the first rule for a quiet life with the dursleys uncle vernon entered the kitchen as harry was turning over the bacon comb your hair he barked by way of a morning greeting about once a week uncle vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that harry needed a haircut harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put 20 the vanishing glass together but it made no difference his hair simply grew that way all over the place harry was frying eggs by the time dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother dudley looked a lot like uncle vernon he had a large pink face not much neck small watery blue eyes and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick fat head aunt petunia often said that dudley looked like a baby angel harry often said that dudley looked like a pig in a wig harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table which was difficult as there wasnt much room dudley meanwhile was counting his presents his face fell thirtysix he said looking up at his mother and father thats two less than last year darling you havent counted auntie marges present see its here under this big one from mommy and daddy all right thirtyseven then said dudley going red in the face harry who could see a huge dudley tantrum coming on began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case dudley turned the table over aunt petunia obviously scented danger too because she said quickly and well buy you another two presents while were out today hows that popkin two more presents is that all right dudley thought for a moment it looked like hard work finally he said slowly so ill have thirty thirty thirtynine sweetums said aunt petunia oh dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel all right then uncle vernon chuckled 21 chapter two little tyke wants his moneys worth just like his father atta boy dudley he ruffled dudleys hair at that moment the telephone rang and aunt petunia went to answer it while harry and uncle vernon watched dudley unwrap the racing bike a video camera a remote control airplane sixteen new computer games and a vcr he was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when aunt petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried bad news vernon she said mrs figgs broken her leg she cant take him she jerked her head in harrys direction dudleys mouth fell open in horror but harrys heart gave a leap every year on dudleys birthday his parents took him and a friend out for the day to adventure parks hamburger restaurants or the movies every year harry was left behind with mrs figg a mad old lady who lived two streets away harry hated it there the whole house smelled of cabbage and mrs figg made him look at photographs of all the cats shed ever owned now what said aunt petunia looking furiously at harry as though hed planned this harry knew he ought to feel sorry that mrs figg had broken her leg but it wasnt easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at tibbies snowy mr paws and tufty again we could phone marge uncle vernon suggested dont be silly vernon she hates the boy the dursleys often spoke about harry like this as though he wasnt there or rather as though he was something very nasty that couldnt understand them like a slug what about whatshername your friend yvonne 22 the vanishing glass on vacation in majorca snapped aunt petunia you could just leave me here harry put in hopefully hed be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on dudleys computer aunt petunia looked as though shed just swallowed a lemon and come back and find the house in ruins she snarled i wont blow up the house said harry but they werent listening i suppose we could take him to the zoo said aunt petunia slowly and leave him in the car that cars new hes not sitting in it alone dudley began to cry loudly in fact he wasnt really crying it had been years since hed really cried but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed his mother would give him anything he wanted dinky duddydums dont cry mummy wont let him spoil your special day she cried flinging her arms around him i dont want him ttto come dudley yelled between huge pretend sobs he always spspoils everything he shot harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms just then the doorbell rang oh good lord theyre here said aunt petunia frantically and a moment later dudleys best friend piers polkiss walked in with his mother piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat he was usually the one who held peoples arms behind their backs while dudley hit them dudley stopped pretending to cry at once half an hour later harry who couldnt believe his luck was sitting in the back of the dursleys car with piers and dudley on the 23 chapter two way to the zoo for the first time in his life his aunt and uncle hadnt been able to think of anything else to do with him but before theyd left uncle vernon had taken harry aside im warning you he had said putting his large purple face right up close to harrys im warning you now boy any funny business anything at all and youll be in that cupboard from now until christmas im not going to do anything said harry honestly but uncle vernon didnt believe him no one ever did the problem was strange things often happened around harry and it was just no good telling the dursleys he didnt make them happen once aunt petunia tired of harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadnt been at all had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs which she left to hide that horrible scar dudley had laughed himself silly at harry who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses next morning however he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before aunt petunia had sheared it off he had been given a week in his cupboard for this even though he had tried to explain that he couldnt explain how it had grown back so quickly another time aunt petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of dudleys brown with orange puff balls the harder she tried to pull it over his head the smaller it seemed to become until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet but certainly wouldnt fit harry aunt petunia had decided it must 24 the vanishing glass have shrunk in the wash and to his great relief harry wasnt punished on the other hand hed gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens dudleys gang had been chasing him as usual when as much to harrys surprise as anyone elses there he was sitting on the chimney the dursleys had received a very angry letter from harrys headmistress telling them harry had been climbing school buildings but all hed tried to do as he shouted at uncle vernon through the locked door of his cupboard was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in midjump but today nothing was going to go wrong it was even worth being with dudley and piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasnt school his cupboard or mrs figgs cabbagesmelling living room while he drove uncle vernon complained to aunt petunia he liked to complain about things people at work harry the council harry the bank and harry were just a few of his favorite subjects this morning it was motorcycles roaring along like maniacs the young hoodlums he said as a motorcycle overtook them i had a dream about a motorcycle said harry remembering suddenly it was flying uncle vernon nearly crashed into the car in front he turned right around in his seat and yelled at harry his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache motorcycles dont fly dudley and piers sniggered 25 chapter two i know they dont said harry it was only a dream but he wished he hadnt said anything if there was one thing the dursleys hated even more than his asking questions it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldnt no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas it was a very sunny saturday and the zoo was crowded with families the dursleys bought dudley and piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then because the smiling lady in the van had asked harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop it wasnt bad either harry thought licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like dudley except that it wasnt blond harry had the best morning hed had in a long time he was careful to walk a little way apart from the dursleys so that dudley and piers who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime wouldnt fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him they ate in the zoo restaurant and when dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didnt have enough ice cream on top uncle vernon bought him another one and harry was allowed to finish the first harry felt afterward that he should have known it was all too good to last after lunch they went to the reptile house it was cool and dark in there with lit windows all along the walls behind the glass all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone dudley and piers wanted to see huge poisonous 26 the vanishing glass cobras and thick mancrushing pythons dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place it could have wrapped its body twice around uncle vernons car and crushed it into a trash can but at the moment it didnt look in the mood in fact it was fast asleep dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass staring at the glistening brown coils make it move he whined at his father uncle vernon tapped on the glass but the snake didnt budge do it again dudley ordered uncle vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles but the snake just snoozed on this is boring dudley moaned he shuffled away harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake he wouldnt have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long it was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom where the only visitor was aunt petunia hammering on the door to wake you up at least he got to visit the rest of the house the snake suddenly opened its beady eyes slowly very slowly it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with harrys it winked harry stared then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching they werent he looked back at the snake and winked too the snake jerked its head toward uncle vernon and dudley then raised its eyes to the ceiling it gave harry a look that said quite plainly i get that all the time 27 chapter two i know harry murmured through the glass though he wasnt sure the snake could hear him it must be really annoying the snake nodded vigorously where do you come from anyway harry asked the snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass harry peered at it boa constrictor brazil was it nice there the boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and harry read on this specimen was bred in the zoo oh i see so youve never been to brazil as the snake shook its head a deafening shout behind harry made both of them jump dudley mr dursley come and look at this snake you wont believe what its doing dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could out of the way you he said punching harry in the ribs caught by surprise harry fell hard on the concrete floor what came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened one second piers and dudley were leaning right up close to the glass the next they had leapt back with howls of horror harry sat up and gasped the glass front of the boa constrictors tank had vanished the great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly slithering out onto the floor people throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits as the snake slid swiftly past him harry could have sworn a low hissing voice said brazil here i come thanksss amigo the keeper of the reptile house was in shock 28 the vanishing glass but the glass he kept saying where did the glass go the zoo director himself made aunt petunia a cup of strong sweet tea while he apologized over and over again piers and dudley could only gibber as far as harry had seen the snake hadnt done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed but by the time they were all back in uncle vernons car dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg while piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death but worst of all for harry at least was piers calming down enough to say harry was talking to it werent you harry uncle vernon waited until piers was safely out of the house before starting on harry he was so angry he could hardly speak he managed to say go cupboard stay no meals before he collapsed into a chair and aunt petunia had to run and get him a large brandy harry lay in his dark cupboard much later wishing he had a watch he didnt know what time it was and he couldnt be sure the dursleys were asleep yet until they were he couldnt risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food hed lived with the dursleys almost ten years ten miserable years as long as he could remember ever since hed been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash he couldnt remember being in the car when his parents had died sometimes when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard he came up with a strange vision a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead this he supposed was the crash though he couldnt imagine where all the green light came from he 29 chapter two couldnt remember his parents at all his aunt and uncle never spoke about them and of course he was forbidden to ask questions there were no photographs of them in the house when he had been younger harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away but it had never happened the dursleys were his only family yet sometimes he thought or maybe hoped that strangers in the street seemed to know him very strange strangers they were too a tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with aunt petunia and dudley after asking harry furiously if he knew the man aunt petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything a wildlooking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus a bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word the weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second harry tried to get a closer look at school harry had no one everybody knew that dudleys gang hated that odd harry potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses and nobody liked to disagree with dudleys gang 30 chapter three the letters from no one t he escape of the brazilian boa constrictor earned harry his longestever punishment by the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again the summer holidays had started and dudley had already broken his new video camera crashed his remote control airplane and first time out on his racing bike knocked down old mrs figg as she crossed privet drive on her crutches harry was glad school was over but there was no escaping dudleys gang who visited the house every single day piers dennis malcolm and gordon were all big and stupid but as dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot he was the leader the rest of them were all quite happy to join in dudleys favorite sport harry hunting this was why harry spent as much time as possible out of the house wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays where he could see a tiny ray of hope when september came he would be going off to secondary school and for the first time in 31 chapter three his life he wouldnt be with dudley dudley had been accepted at uncle vernons old private school smeltings piers polkiss was going there too harry on the other hand was going to stonewall high the local public school dudley thought this was very funny they stuff peoples heads down the toilet the first day at stonewall he told harry want to come upstairs and practice no thanks said harry the poor toilets never had anything as horrible as your head down it it might be sick then he ran before dudley could work out what hed said one day in july aunt petunia took dudley to london to buy his smeltings uniform leaving harry at mrs figgs mrs figg wasnt as bad as usual it turned out shed broken her leg tripping over one of her cats and she didnt seem quite as fond of them as before she let harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though shed had it for several years that evening dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brandnew uniform smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats orange knickerbockers and flat straw hats called boaters they also carried knobbly sticks used for hitting each other while the teachers werent looking this was supposed to be good training for later life as he looked at dudley in his new knickerbockers uncle vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life aunt petunia burst into tears and said she couldnt believe it was her ickle dudleykins he looked so handsome and grownup harry didnt trust himself to speak he thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh 32 the letters from no one there was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when harry went in for breakfast it seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink he went to have a look the tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water whats this he asked aunt petunia her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question your new school uniform she said harry looked in the bowl again oh he said i didnt realize it had to be so wet dont be stupid snapped aunt petunia im dyeing some of dudleys old things gray for you itll look just like everyone elses when ive finished harry seriously doubted this but thought it best not to argue he sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at stonewall high like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin probably dudley and uncle vernon came in both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from harrys new uniform uncle vernon opened his newspaper as usual and dudley banged his smelting stick which he carried everywhere on the table they heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat get the mail dudley said uncle vernon from behind his paper make harry get it get the mail harry make dudley get it poke him with your smelting stick dudley 33 chapter three harry dodged the smelting stick and went to get the mail three things lay on the doormat a postcard from uncle vernons sister marge who was vacationing on the isle of wight a brown envelope that looked like a bill and a letter for harry harry picked it up and stared at it his heart twanging like a giant elastic band no one ever in his whole life had written to him who would he had no friends no other relatives he didnt belong to the library so hed never even got rude notes asking for books back yet here it was a letter addressed so plainly there could be no mistake mr h potter the cupboard under the stairs 4 privet drive little whinging surrey the envelope was thick and heavy made of yellowish parchment and the address was written in emeraldgreen ink there was no stamp turning the envelope over his hand trembling harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms a lion an eagle a badger and a snake surrounding a large letter h hurry up boy shouted uncle vernon from the kitchen what are you doing checking for letter bombs he chuckled at his own joke harry went back to the kitchen still staring at his letter he handed uncle vernon the bill and the postcard sat down and slowly began to open the yellow envelope 34 the letters from no one uncle vernon ripped open the bill snorted in disgust and flipped over the postcard marges ill he informed aunt petunia ate a funny whelk dad said dudley suddenly dad harrys got something harry was on the point of unfolding his letter which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by uncle vernon thats mine said harry trying to snatch it back whod be writing to you sneered uncle vernon shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it his face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights and it didnt stop there within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge pppetunia he gasped dudley tried to grab the letter to read it but uncle vernon held it high out of his reach aunt petunia took it curiously and read the first line for a moment it looked as though she might faint she clutched her throat and made a choking noise vernon oh my goodness vernon they stared at each other seeming to have forgotten that harry and dudley were still in the room dudley wasnt used to being ignored he gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his smelting stick i want to read that letter he said loudly i want to read it said harry furiously as its mine get out both of you croaked uncle vernon stuffing the letter back inside its envelope harry didnt move i want my letter he shouted 35 chapter three let me see it demanded dudley out roared uncle vernon and he took both harry and dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall slamming the kitchen door behind them harry and dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole dudley won so harry his glasses dangling from one ear lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor vernon aunt petunia was saying in a quivering voice look at the address how could they possibly know where he sleeps you dont think theyre watching the house watching spying might be following us muttered uncle vernon wildly but what should we do vernon should we write back tell them we dont want harry could see uncle vernons shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen no he said finally no well ignore it if they dont get an answer yes thats best we wont do anything but im not having one in the house petunia didnt we swear when we took him in wed stamp out that dangerous nonsense that evening when he got back from work uncle vernon did something hed never done before he visited harry in his cupboard wheres my letter said harry the moment uncle vernon had squeezed through the door whos writing to me 36 the letters from no one no one it was addressed to you by mistake said uncle vernon shortly i have burned it it was not a mistake said harry angrily it had my cupboard on it silence yelled uncle vernon and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling he took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile which looked quite painful er yes harry about this cupboard your aunt and i have been thinking youre really getting a bit big for it we think it might be nice if you moved into dudleys second bedroom why said harry dont ask questions snapped his uncle take this stuff upstairs now the dursleys house had four bedrooms one for uncle vernon and aunt petunia one for visitors usually uncle vernons sister marge one where dudley slept and one where dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldnt fit into his first bedroom it only took harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room he sat down on the bed and stared around him nearly everything in here was broken the monthold video camera was lying on top of a small working tank dudley had once driven over the next door neighbors dog in the corner was dudleys firstever television set which hed put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled there was a large birdcage which had once held a parrot that dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because dudley had sat on it other shelves were full of 37 chapter three books they were the only things in the room that looked as though theyd never been touched from downstairs came the sound of dudley bawling at his mother i dont want him in there i need that room make him get out harry sighed and stretched out on the bed yesterday hed have given anything to be up here today hed rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it next morning at breakfast everyone was rather quiet dudley was in shock hed screamed whacked his father with his smelting stick been sick on purpose kicked his mother and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof and he still didnt have his room back harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing hed opened the letter in the hall uncle vernon and aunt petunia kept looking at each other darkly when the mail arrived uncle vernon who seemed to be trying to be nice to harry made dudley go and get it they heard him banging things with his smelting stick all the way down the hall then he shouted theres another one mr h potter the smallest bedroom 4 privet drive with a strangled cry uncle vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall harry right behind him uncle vernon had to wrestle dudley to the ground to get the letter from him which was made difficult by the fact that harry had grabbed uncle vernon around the neck from behind after a minute of confused fighting in which everyone got hit a lot by the smelting stick uncle vernon straightened up gasping for breath with harrys letter clutched in his hand 38 the letters from no one go to your cupboard i mean your bedroom he wheezed at harry dudley go just go harry walked round and round his new room someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadnt received his first letter surely that meant theyd try again and this time hed make sure they didnt fail he had a plan the repaired alarm clock rang at six oclock the next morning harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently he mustnt wake the dursleys he stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights he was going to wait for the postman on the corner of privet drive and get the letters for number four first his heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door aaaaarrrgh harry leapt into the air hed trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat something alive lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror harry realized that the big squashy something had been his uncles face uncle vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag clearly making sure that harry didnt do exactly what hed been trying to do he shouted at harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back the mail had arrived right into uncle vernons lap harry could see three letters addressed in green ink i want he began but uncle vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes 39 chapter three uncle vernon didnt go to work that day he stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot see he explained to aunt petunia through a mouthful of nails if they cant deliver them theyll just give up im not sure thatll work vernon oh these peoples minds work in strange ways petunia theyre not like you and me said uncle vernon trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake aunt petunia had just brought him on friday no less than twelve letters arrived for harry as they couldnt go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door slotted through the sides and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom uncle vernon stayed at home again after burning all the letters he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out he hummed tiptoe through the tulips as he worked and jumped at small noises on saturday things began to get out of hand twentyfour letters to harry found their way into the house rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed aunt petunia through the living room window while uncle vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to aunt petunia shredded the letters in her food processor who on earth wants to talk to you this badly dudley asked harry in amazement 40 the letters from no one on sunday morning uncle vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill but happy no post on sundays he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers no damn letters today something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head next moment thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets the dursleys ducked but harry leapt into the air trying to catch one out out uncle vernon seized harry around the waist and threw him into the hall when aunt petunia and dudley had run out with their arms over their faces uncle vernon slammed the door shut they could hear the letters still streaming into the room bouncing off the walls and floor that does it said uncle vernon trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time i want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave were going away just pack some clothes no arguments he looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boardedup doors and were in the car speeding toward the highway dudley was sniffling in the back seat his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television vcr and computer in his sports bag they drove and they drove even aunt petunia didnt dare ask where they were going every now and then uncle vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while 41 chapter three shake em off shake em off he would mutter whenever he did this they didnt stop to eat or drink all day by nightfall dudley was howling hed never had such a bad day in his life he was hungry hed missed five television programs hed wanted to see and hed never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer uncle vernon stopped at last outside a gloomylooking hotel on the outskirts of a big city dudley and harry shared a room with twin beds and damp musty sheets dudley snored but harry stayed awake sitting on the windowsill staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering they ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day they had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table scuse me but is one of you mr h potter only i got about an undred of these at the front desk she held up a letter so they could read the green ink address mr h potter room 17 railview hotel cokeworth harry made a grab for the letter but uncle vernon knocked his hand out of the way the woman stared ill take them said uncle vernon standing up quickly and following her from the dining room 42 the letters from no one wouldnt it be better just to go home dear aunt petunia suggested timidly hours later but uncle vernon didnt seem to hear her exactly what he was looking for none of them knew he drove them into the middle of a forest got out looked around shook his head got back in the car and off they went again the same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field halfway across a suspension bridge and at the top of a multilevel parking garage daddys gone mad hasnt he dudley asked aunt petunia dully late that afternoon uncle vernon had parked at the coast locked them all inside the car and disappeared it started to rain great drops beat on the roof of the car dudley sniveled its monday he told his mother the great humbertos on tonight i want to stay somewhere with a television monday this reminded harry of something if it was monday and you could usually count on dudley to know the days of the week because of television then tomorrow tuesday was harrys eleventh birthday of course his birthdays were never exactly fun last year the dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of uncle vernons old socks still you werent eleven every day uncle vernon was back and he was smiling he was also carrying a long thin package and didnt answer aunt petunia when she asked what hed bought found the perfect place he said come on everyone out it was very cold outside the car uncle vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea perched on top of the 43 chapter three rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine one thing was certain there was no television in there storm forecast for tonight said uncle vernon gleefully clapping his hands together and this gentlemans kindly agreed to lend us his boat a toothless old man came ambling up to them pointing with a rather wicked grin at an old rowboat bobbing in the irongray water below them ive already got us some rations said uncle vernon so all aboard it was freezing in the boat icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces after what seemed like hours they reached the rock where uncle vernon slipping and sliding led the way to the brokendown house the inside was horrible it smelled strongly of seaweed the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls and the fireplace was damp and empty there were only two rooms uncle vernons rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas he tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up could do with some of those letters now eh he said cheerfully he was in a very good mood obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail harry privately agreed though the thought didnt cheer him up at all as night fell the promised storm blew up around them spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce 44 the letters from no one wind rattled the filthy windows aunt petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for dudley on the motheaten sofa she and uncle vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door and harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest most ragged blanket the storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on harry couldnt sleep he shivered and turned over trying to get comfortable his stomach rumbling with hunger dudleys snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight the lighted dial of dudleys watch which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist told harry hed be eleven in ten minutes time he lay and watched his birthday tick nearer wondering if the dursleys would remember at all wondering where the letter writer was now five minutes to go harry heard something creak outside he hoped the roof wasnt going to fall in although he might be warmer if it did four minutes to go maybe the house in privet drive would be so full of letters when they got back that hed be able to steal one somehow three minutes to go was that the sea slapping hard on the rock like that and two minutes to go what was that funny crunching noise was the rock crumbling into the sea one minute to go and hed be eleven thirty seconds twenty ten nine maybe hed wake dudley up just to annoy him three two one boom the whole shack shivered and harry sat bolt upright staring at the door someone was outside knocking to come in 45 chapter four the keeper of the keys b oom they knocked again dudley jerked awake wheres the cannon he said stupidly there was a crash behind them and uncle vernon came skidding into the room he was holding a rifle in his hands now they knew what had been in the long thin package he had brought with them whos there he shouted i warn you im armed there was a pause then smash the door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor a giant of a man was standing in the doorway his face was almost completely hidden by a long shaggy mane of hair and a wild tangled beard but you could make out his eyes glinting like black beetles under all the hair 46 the keeper of the keys the giant squeezed his way into the hut stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling he bent down picked up the door and fitted it easily back into its frame the noise of the storm outside dropped a little he turned to look at them all couldnt make us a cup o tea could yeh its not been an easy journey he strode over to the sofa where dudley sat frozen with fear budge up yeh great lump said the stranger dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother who was crouching terrified behind uncle vernon an heres harry said the giant harry looked up into the fierce wild shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile las time i saw you you was only a baby said the giant yeh look a lot like yer dad but yehve got yer moms eyes uncle vernon made a funny rasping noise i demand that you leave at once sir he said you are breaking and entering ah shut up dursley yeh great prune said the giant he reached over the back of the sofa jerked the gun out of uncle vernons hands bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber and threw it into a corner of the room uncle vernon made another funny noise like a mouse being trodden on anyway harry said the giant turning his back on the dursleys a very happy birthday to yeh got summat fer yeh here i mighta sat on it at some point but itll taste all right from an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly 47 chapter four squashed box harry opened it with trembling fingers inside was a large sticky chocolate cake with happy birthday harry written on it in green icing harry looked up at the giant he meant to say thank you but the words got lost on the way to his mouth and what he said instead was who are you the giant chuckled true i havent introduced meself rubeus hagrid keeper of keys and grounds at hogwarts he held out an enormous hand and shook harrys whole arm what about that tea then eh he said rubbing his hands together id not say no ter summat stronger if yehve got it mind his eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted he bent down over the fireplace they couldnt see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later there was a roaring fire there it filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and harry felt the warmth wash over him as though hed sunk into a hot bath the giant sat back down on the sofa which sagged under his weight and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat a copper kettle a squashy package of sausages a poker a teapot several chipped mugs and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage nobody said a thing while the giant was working but as he slid the first six fat juicy slightly burnt sausages from the poker dudley fidgeted a little uncle vernon said sharply dont touch anything he gives you dudley the giant chuckled darkly 48 the keeper of the keys yer great puddin of a son don need fattenin anymore dursley don worry he passed the sausages to harry who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful but he still couldnt take his eyes off the giant finally as nobody seemed about to explain anything he said im sorry but i still dont really know who you are the giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand call me hagrid he said everyone does an like i told yeh im keeper of keys at hogwarts yehll know all about hogwarts o course er no said harry hagrid looked shocked sorry harry said quickly sorry barked hagrid turning to stare at the dursleys who shrank back into the shadows its them as should be sorry i knew yeh werent gettin yer letters but i never thought yeh wouldnt even know abou hogwarts fer cryin out loud did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all all what asked harry all what hagrid thundered now wait jus one second he had leapt to his feet in his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut the dursleys were cowering against the wall do you mean ter tell me he growled at the dursleys that this boy this boy knows nothin abou about anything harry thought this was going a bit far he had been to school after all and his marks werent bad i know some things he said i can you know do math and stuff 49 chapter four but hagrid simply waved his hand and said about our world i mean your world my world yer parents world what world hagrid looked as if he was about to explode dursley he boomed uncle vernon who had gone very pale whispered something that sounded like mimblewimble hagrid stared wildly at harry but yeh must know about yer mom and dad he said i mean theyre famous youre famous what my my mom and dad werent famous were they yeh don know yeh don know hagrid ran his fingers through his hair fixing harry with a bewildered stare yeh don know what yeh are he said finally uncle vernon suddenly found his voice stop he commanded stop right there sir i forbid you to tell the boy anything a braver man than vernon dursley would have quailed under the furious look hagrid now gave him when hagrid spoke his every syllable trembled with rage you never told him never told him what was in the letter dumbledore left fer him i was there i saw dumbledore leave it dursley an youve kept it from him all these years kept what from me said harry eagerly stop i forbid you yelled uncle vernon in panic aunt petunia gave a gasp of horror ah go boil yer heads both of yeh said hagrid harry yer a wizard there was silence inside the hut only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard 50 the keeper of the keys im a what gasped harry a wizard o course said hagrid sitting back down on the sofa which groaned and sank even lower an a thumpin goodun id say once yehve been trained up a bit with a mum an dad like yours what else would yeh be an i reckon its abou time yeh read yer letter harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope addressed in emerald green to mr h potter the floor hutontherock the sea he pulled out the letter and read hogwarts school of witchcraft

sincerely minerva mcgonagall deputy headmistress 51 chapter four questions exploded inside harrys head like fireworks and he couldnt decide which to ask first after a few minutes he stammered what does it mean they await my owl gallopin gorgons that reminds me said hagrid clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl a real live rather ruffledlooking owl a long quill and a roll of parchment with his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that harry could read upside down dear professor dumbledore given harry his letter taking him to buy his things tomorrow weathers horrible hope youre well hagrid hagrid rolled up the note gave it to the owl which clamped it in its beak went to the door and threw the owl out into the storm then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly where was i said hagrid but at that moment uncle vernon still ashenfaced but looking very angry moved into the firelight hes not going he said hagrid grunted id like ter see a great muggle like you stop him he said a what said harry interested 52 the keeper of the keys a muggle said hagrid its what we call nonmagic folk like them an its your bad luck you grew up in a family o the biggest muggles i ever laid eyes on we swore when we took him in wed put a stop to that rubbish said uncle vernon swore wed stamp it out of him wizard indeed you knew said harry you knew im a a wizard knew shrieked aunt petunia suddenly knew of course we knew how could you not be my dratted sister being what she was oh she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that that school and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn turning teacups into rats i was the only one who saw her for what she was a freak but for my mother and father oh no it was lily this and lily that they were proud of having a witch in the family she stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on it seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years then she met that potter at school and they left and got married and had you and of course i knew youd be just the same just as strange just as as abnormal and then if you please she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you harry had gone very white as soon as he found his voice he said blown up you told me they died in a car crash car crash roared hagrid jumping up so angrily that the dursleys scuttled back to their corner how could a car crash kill lily an james potter its an outrage a scandal harry potter not knowin his own story when every kid in our world knows his name 53 chapter four but why what happened harry asked

get em on his side before probably knew they were too close ter dumbledore ter want anythin ter do with the dark side maybe he thought he could persuade em maybe he just wanted em outta the way all anyone knows is he turned up in the village where you was all living on halloween ten years ago you was just a year old he came ter yer house an an hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn sorry he said but its that sad knew yer mum an dad an nicer people yeh couldnt find anyway youknowwho killed em an then an this is the real mystry of the thing he tried to kill you too wanted ter make a clean job of it i suppose or maybe he just liked killin by then but he couldnt do it never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead that was no ordinary cut thats what yeh get when a powerful evil curse touches yeh took care of yer mum an dad an yer house even but it didnt work on you an thats why yer famous harry no one ever lived after he decided ter kill em no one except you an hed killed some o the best witches an wizards 55 chapter four of the age the mckinnons the bones the prewetts an you was only a baby an you lived something very painful was going on in harrys mind as hagrids story came to a close he saw again the blinding flash of green light more clearly than he had ever remembered it before and he remembered something else for the first time in his life a high cold cruel laugh hagrid was watching him sadly took yeh from the ruined house myself on dumbledores orders brought yeh ter this lot load of old tosh said uncle vernon harry jumped he had almost forgotten that the dursleys were there uncle vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage he was glaring at hagrid and his fists were clenched now you listen here boy he snarled i accept theres something strange about you probably nothing a good beating wouldnt have cured and as for all this about your parents well they were weirdos no denying it and the worlds better off without them in my opinion asked for all they got getting mixed up with these wizarding types just what i expected always knew theyd come to a sticky end but at that moment hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat pointing this at uncle vernon like a sword he said im warning you dursley im warning you one more word in danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant uncle vernons courage failed again he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent 56 the keeper of the keys thats better said hagrid breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa which this time sagged right down to the floor harry meanwhile still had questions to ask hundreds of them but what happened to vol sorry i mean youknowwho good question harry disappeared vanished same night he tried ter kill you makes yeh even more famous thats the biggest mystry see he was gettin more an more powerful whyd he go some say he died codswallop in my opinion dunno if he had enough human left in him to die some say hes still out there bidin his time like but i don believe it people who was on his side came back ter ours some of em came outta kinda trances don reckon they couldve done if he was comin back most of us reckon hes still out there somewhere but lost his powers too weak to carry on cause somethin about you finished him harry there was somethin goin on that night he hadnt counted on i dunno what it was no one does but somethin about you stumped him all right hagrid looked at harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes but harry instead of feeling pleased and proud felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake a wizard him how could he possibly be hed spent his life being clouted by dudley and bullied by aunt petunia and uncle vernon if he was really a wizard why hadnt they been turned into warty toads every time theyd tried to lock him in his cupboard if hed once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world how come dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football 57 chapter four hagrid he said quietly i think you must have made a mistake i dont think i can be a wizard to his surprise hagrid chuckled not a wizard eh never made things happen when you was scared or angry harry looked into the fire now he came to think about it every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he harry had been upset or angry chased by dudleys gang he had somehow found himself out of their reach dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut hed managed to make it grow back and the very last time dudley had hit him hadnt he got his revenge without even realizing he was doing it hadnt he set a boa constrictor on him harry looked back at hagrid smiling and saw that hagrid was positively beaming at him see said hagrid harry potter not a wizard you wait youll be right famous at hogwarts but uncle vernon wasnt going to give in without a fight havent i told you hes not going he hissed hes going to stonewall high and hell be grateful for it ive read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish spell books and wands and if he wants ter go a great muggle like you wont stop him growled hagrid stop lily an james potters son goin ter hogwarts yer mad his names been down ever since he was born hes off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world seven years there and he wont know himself hell be with youngsters of his own sort fer a change an hell be under the greatest headmaster hogwarts ever had albus dumbled 58 the keeper of the keys i am not paying for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks yelled uncle vernon but he had finally gone too far hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head never he thundered insult albus dumbledore in front of me he brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at dudley there was a flash of violet light a sound like a firecracker a sharp squeal and the next second dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom howling in pain when he turned his back on them harry saw a curly pigs tail poking through a hole in his trousers uncle vernon roared pulling aunt petunia and dudley into the other room he cast one last terrified look at hagrid and slammed the door behind them hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard shouldnta lost me temper he said ruefully but it didnt work anyway meant ter turn him into a pig but i suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasnt much left ter do he cast a sideways look at harry under his bushy eyebrows be grateful if yeh didnt mention that ter anyone at hogwarts he said im er not supposed ter do magic strictly speakin i was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an get yer letters to yeh an stuff one o the reasons i was so keen ter take on the job why arent you supposed to do magic asked harry oh well i was at hogwarts meself but i er got expelled ter tell yeh the truth in me third year they snapped me wand in half an everything but dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper great man dumbledore 59 chapter four why were you expelled its gettin late and weve got lots ter do tomorrow said hagrid loudly gotta get up ter town get all yer books an that he took off his thick black coat and threw it to harry you can kip under that he said don mind if it wriggles a bit i think i still got a couple o dormice in one o the pockets 60 chapter five diagon alley h arry woke early the next morning although he could tell it was daylight he kept his eyes shut tight it was a dream he told himself firmly i dreamed a giant called hagrid came to tell me i was going to a school for wizards when i open my eyes ill be at home in my cupboard there was suddenly a loud tapping noise and theres aunt petunia knocking on the door harry thought his heart sinking but he still didnt open his eyes it had been such a good dream tap tap tap all right harry mumbled im getting up he sat up and hagrids heavy coat fell off him the hut was full of sunlight the storm was over hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window a newspaper held in its beak 61 chapter five harry scrambled to his feet so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him he went straight to the window and jerked it open the owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of hagrid who didnt wake up the owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack hagrids coat dont do that harry tried to wave the owl out of the way but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat hagrid said harry loudly theres an owl pay him hagrid grunted into the sofa what he wants payin fer deliverin the paper look in the pockets hagrids coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets bunches of keys slug pellets balls of string peppermint humbugs teabags finally harry pulled out a handful of strangelooking coins give him five knuts said hagrid sleepily knuts the little bronze ones harry counted out five little bronze coins and the owl held out his leg so harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it then he flew off through the open window hagrid yawned loudly sat up and stretched best be off harry lots ter do today gotta get up ter london an buy all yer stuff fer school harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them he had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture 62 diagon alley um hagrid mm said hagrid who was pulling on his huge boots i havent got any money and you heard uncle vernon last night he wont pay for me to go and learn magic dont worry about that said hagrid standing up and scratching his head dyeh think yer parents didnt leave yeh anything but if their house was destroyed they didn keep their gold in the house boy nah first stop fer us is gringotts wizards bank have a sausage theyre not bad cold an i wouldn say no teh a bit o yer birthday cake neither wizards have banks just the one gringotts run by goblins harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding goblins yeah so yehd be mad ter try an rob it ill tell yeh that never mess with goblins harry gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe cept maybe hogwarts as a matter o fact i gotta visit gringotts anyway fer dumbledore hogwarts business hagrid drew himself up proudly he usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him fetchin you gettin things from gringotts knows he can trust me see got everythin come on then harry followed hagrid out onto the rock the sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight the boat uncle vernon had hired was still there with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm how did you get here harry asked looking around for another boat 63 chapter five flew said hagrid flew yeah but well go back in this not spposed ter use magic now ive got yeh they settled down in the boat harry still staring at hagrid trying to imagine him flying seems a shame ter row though said hagrid giving harry another of his sideways looks if i was ter er speed things up a bit would yeh mind not mentionin it at hogwarts of course not said harry eager to see more magic hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again tapped it twice on the side of the boat and they sped off toward land why would you be mad to try and rob gringotts harry asked spells enchantments said hagrid unfolding his newspaper as he spoke they say theres dragons guardin the highsecurity vaults and then yeh gotta find yer way gringotts is hundreds of miles under london see deep under the underground yehd die of hunger tryin ter get out even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat harry sat and thought about this while hagrid read his newspaper the daily prophet harry had learned from uncle vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this but it was very difficult hed never had so many questions in his life ministry o magic messin things up as usual hagrid muttered turning the page theres a ministry of magic harry asked before he could stop himself course said hagrid they wanted dumbledore fer minis 64 diagon alley ter o course but hed never leave hogwarts so old cornelius fudge got the job bungler if ever there was one so he pelts dumbledore with owls every morning askin fer advice but what does a ministry of magic do well their main job is to keep it from the muggles that theres still witches an wizards up an down the country why why blimey harry everyoned be wantin magic solutions to their problems nah were best left alone at this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall hagrid folded up his newspaper and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street passersby stared a lot at hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station harry couldnt blame them not only was hagrid twice as tall as anyone else he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly see that harry things these muggles dream up eh hagrid said harry panting a bit as he ran to keep up did you say there are dragons at gringotts well so they say said hagrid crikey id like a dragon youd like one wanted one ever since i was a kid here we go they had reached the station there was a train to london in five minutes time hagrid who didnt understand muggle money as he called it gave the bills to harry so he could buy their tickets people stared more than ever on the train hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canaryyellow circus tent still got yer letter harry he asked as he counted stitches 65 chapter five harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket good said hagrid theres a list there of everything yeh need harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadnt noticed the night before and read hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry uniform firstyear students will require 1 three sets of plain work robes black 2 one plain pointed hat black for day wear 3 one pair of protective gloves dragon hide or similar 4 one

are not allowed their own broomsticks can we buy all this in london harry wondered aloud if yeh know where to go said hagrid harry had never been to london before although hagrid seemed to know where he was going he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way he got stuck in the ticket barrier on the underground and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow i dont know how the muggles manage without magic he said as they climbed a brokendown escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily all harry 67 chapter five had to do was keep close behind him they passed book shops and music stores hamburger restaurants and cinemas but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand this was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks might this not all be some huge joke that the dursleys had cooked up if harry hadnt known that the dursleys had no sense of humor he might have thought so yet somehow even though everything hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable harry couldnt help trusting him this is it said hagrid coming to a halt the leaky cauldron its a famous place it was a tiny grubbylooking pub if hagrid hadnt pointed it out harry wouldnt have noticed it was there the people hurrying by didnt glance at it their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldnt see the leaky cauldron at all in fact harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and hagrid could see it before he could mention this hagrid had steered him inside for a famous place it was very dark and shabby a few old women were sitting in a corner drinking tiny glasses of sherry one of them was smoking a long pipe a little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut the low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in everyone seemed to know hagrid they waved and smiled at him and the bartender reached for a glass saying the usual hagrid 68 diagon alley cant tom im on hogwarts business said hagrid clapping his great hand on harrys shoulder and making harrys knees buckle good lord said the bartender peering at harry is this can this be the leaky cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent bless my soul whispered the old bartender harry potter what an honor he hurried out from behind the bar rushed toward harry and seized his hand tears in his eyes welcome back mr potter welcome back harry didnt know what to say everyone was looking at him the old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out hagrid was beaming then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the leaky cauldron doris crockford mr potter cant believe im meeting you at last so proud mr potter im just so proud always wanted to shake your hand im all of a flutter delighted mr potter just cant tell you diggles the name dedalus diggle ive seen you before said harry as dedalus diggles top hat fell off in his excitement you bowed to me once in a shop he remembers cried dedalus diggle looking around at everyone did you hear that he remembers me 69 chapter five harry shook hands again and again doris crockford kept coming back for more a pale young man made his way forward very nervously one of his eyes was twitching professor quirrell said hagrid harry professor quirrell will be one of your teachers at hogwarts pppotter stammered professor quirrell grasping harrys hand ccant ttell you how ppleased i am to meet you what sort of magic do you teach professor quirrell ddefense against the dddark arts muttered professor quirrell as though hed rather not think about it nnot that you nneed it eh pppotter he laughed nervously youll be ggetting all your equipment i suppose ive ggot to ppick up a new bbook on vampires mmyself he looked terrified at the very thought but the others wouldnt let professor quirrell keep harry to himself it took almost ten minutes to get away from them all at last hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble must get on lots ter buy come on harry doris crockford shook harrys hand one last time and hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small walled courtyard where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds hagrid grinned at harry told yeh didnt i told yeh you was famous even professor quirrell was tremblin ter meet yeh mind you hes usually tremblin is he always that nervous oh yeah poor bloke brilliant mind he was fine while he was 70 diagon alley studyin outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience they say he met vampires in the black forest and there was a nasty bit o trouble with a hag never been the same since scared of the students scared of his own subject now wheres me umbrella vampires hags harrys head was swimming hagrid meanwhile was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can three up two across he muttered right stand back harry he tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella the brick he had touched quivered it wriggled in the middle a small hole appeared it grew wider and wider a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for hagrid an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight welcome said hagrid to diagon alley he grinned at harrys amazement they stepped through the archway harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall the sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop cauldrons all sizes copper brass pewter silver selfstirring collapsible said a sign hanging over them yeah youll be needin one said hagrid but we gotta get yer money first harry wished he had about eight more eyes he turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street trying to look at everything at once the shops the things outside them the people doing their shopping a plump woman outside an apothecary was 71 chapter five shaking her head as they passed saying dragon liver sixteen sickles an ounce theyre mad a low soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying eeylops owl emporium tawny screech barn brown and snowy several boys of about harrys age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it look harry heard one of them say the new nimbus two thousand fastest ever there were shops selling robes shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments harry had never seen before windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels eyes tottering piles of spell books quills and rolls of parchment potion bottles globes of the moon gringotts said hagrid they had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops standing beside its burnished bronze doors wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold was yeah thats a goblin said hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him the goblin was about a head shorter than harry he had a swarthy clever face a pointed beard and harry noticed very long fingers and feet he bowed as they walked inside now they were facing a second pair of doors silver this time with words engraved upon them enter stranger but take heed of what awaits the sin of greed for those who take but do not earn must pay most dearly in their turn so if you seek beneath our floors a treasure that was never yours 72 diagon alley thief you have been warned beware of finding more than treasure there like i said yehd be mad ter try an rob it said hagrid a pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall about a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter scribbling in large ledgers weighing coins in brass scales examining precious stones through eyeglasses there were too many doors to count leading off the hall and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these hagrid and harry made for the counter morning said hagrid to a free goblin weve come ter take some money outta mr harry potters safe you have his key sir got it here somewhere said hagrid and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers the goblin wrinkled his nose harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals got it said hagrid at last holding up a tiny golden key the goblin looked at it closely that seems to be in order an ive also got a letter here from professor dumbledore said hagrid importantly throwing out his chest its about the youknowwhat in vault seven hundred and thirteen the goblin read the letter carefully very well he said handing it back to hagrid i will have someone take you down to both vaults griphook griphook was yet another goblin once hagrid had crammed 73 chapter five all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets he and harry followed griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall whats the youknowwhat in vault seven hundred and thirteen harry asked cant tell yeh that said hagrid mysteriously very secret hogwarts business dumbledores trusted me moren my jobs worth ter tell yeh that griphook held the door open for them harry who had expected more marble was surprised they were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches it sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them they climbed in hagrid with some difficulty and were off at first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages harry tried to remember left right right left middle fork right left but it was impossible the rattling cart seemed to know its own way because griphook wasnt steering harrys eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them but he kept them wide open once he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon but too late they plunged even deeper passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor i never know harry called to hagrid over the noise of the cart whats the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite stalagmites got an m in it said hagrid an don ask me questions just now i think im gonna be sick 74 diagon alley he did look very green and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling griphook unlocked the door a lot of green smoke came billowing out and as it cleared harry gasped inside were mounds of gold coins columns of silver heaps of little bronze knuts all yours smiled hagrid all harrys it was incredible the dursleys couldnt have known about this or theyd have had it from him faster than blinking how often had they complained how much harry cost them to keep and all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him buried deep under london hagrid helped harry pile some of it into a bag the gold ones are galleons he explained seventeen silver sickles to a galleon and twentynine knuts to a sickle its easy enough right that should be enough fer a couple o terms well keep the rest safe for yeh he turned to griphook vault seven hundred and thirteen now please and can we go more slowly one speed only said griphook they were going even deeper now and gathering speed the air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners they went rattling over an underground ravine and harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom but hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole stand back said griphook importantly he stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away 75 chapter five if anyone but a gringotts goblin tried that theyd be sucked through the door and trapped in there said griphook how often do you check to see if anyones inside harry asked about once every ten years said griphook with a rather nasty grin something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault harry was sure and he leaned forward eagerly expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least but at first he thought it was empty then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat harry longed to know what it was but knew better than to ask come on back in this infernal cart and dont talk to me on the way back its best if i keep me mouth shut said hagrid one wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside gringotts harry didnt know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money he didnt have to know how many galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than hed had in his whole life more money than even dudley had ever had might as well get yer uniform said hagrid nodding toward madam malkins robes for all occasions listen harry would yeh mind if i slipped off fer a pickmeup in the leaky cauldron i hate them gringotts carts he did still look a bit sick so harry entered madam malkins shop alone feeling nervous madam malkin was a squat smiling witch dressed all in mauve 76 diagon alley hogwarts dear she said when harry started to speak got the lot here another young man being fitted up just now in fact in the back of the shop a boy with a pale pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes madam malkin stood harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head and began to pin it to the right length hello said the boy hogwarts too yes said harry my fathers next door buying my books and mothers up the street looking at wands said the boy he had a bored drawling voice then im going to drag them off to look at racing brooms i dont see why first years cant have their own i think ill bully father into getting me one and ill smuggle it in somehow harry was strongly reminded of dudley have you got your own broom the boy went on no said harry play quidditch at all no harry said again wondering what on earth quidditch could be i do father says its a crime if im not picked to play for my house and i must say i agree know what house youll be in yet no said harry feeling more stupid by the minute well no one really knows until they get there do they but i know ill be in slytherin all our family have been imagine being in hufflepuff i think id leave wouldnt you 77 chapter five mmm said harry wishing he could say something a bit more interesting i say look at that man said the boy suddenly nodding toward the front window hagrid was standing there grinning at harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldnt come in thats hagrid said harry pleased to know something the boy didnt he works at hogwarts oh said the boy ive heard of him hes a sort of servant isnt he hes the gamekeeper said harry he was liking the boy less and less every second yes exactly i heard hes a sort of savage lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk tries to do magic and ends up setting fire to his bed i think hes brilliant said harry coldly do you said the boy with a slight sneer why is he with you where are your parents theyre dead said harry shortly he didnt feel much like going into the matter with this boy oh sorry said the other not sounding sorry at all but they were our kind werent they they were a witch and wizard if thats what you mean i really dont think they should let the other sort in do you theyre just not the same theyve never been brought up to know our ways some of them have never even heard of hogwarts until they get the letter imagine i think they should keep it in the old wizarding families whats your surname anyway but before harry could answer madam malkin said thats 78 diagon alley you done my dear and harry not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy hopped down from the footstool well ill see you at hogwarts i suppose said the drawling boy harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream hagrid had bought him chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts whats up said hagrid nothing harry lied they stopped to buy parchment and quills harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote when they had left the shop he said hagrid whats quidditch blimey harry i keep forgettin how little yeh know not knowin about quidditch dont make me feel worse said harry he told hagrid about the pale boy in madam malkins and he said people from muggle families shouldnt even be allowed in yer not from a muggle family if hed known who yeh were hes grown up knowin yer name if his parents are wizardin folk you saw what everyone in the leaky cauldron was like when they saw yeh anyway what does he know about it some o the best i ever saw were the only ones with magic in em in a long line o muggles look at yer mum look what she had fer a sister so what is quidditch its our sport wizard sport its like like soccer in the muggle world everyone follows quidditch played up in the air on broomsticks and theres four balls sorta hard ter explain the rules 79 chapter five and what are slytherin and hufflepuff school houses theres four everyone says hufflepuff are a lot o duffers but i bet im in hufflepuff said harry gloomily better hufflepuff than slytherin said hagrid darkly theres not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasnt in slytherin youknowwho was one vol sorry youknowwho was at hogwarts years an years ago said hagrid they bought harrys school books in a shop called flourish and blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all even dudley who never read anything would have been wild to get his hands on some of these hagrid almost had to drag harry away from curses and countercurses bewitch your friends and befuddle your enemies with the latest revenges hair loss jellylegs tonguetying and much much more by professor vindictus viridian i was trying to find out how to curse dudley im not sayin thats not a good idea but yer not ter use magic in the muggle world except in very special circumstances said hagrid an anyway yeh couldn work any of them curses yet yehll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level hagrid wouldnt let harry buy a solid gold cauldron either it says pewter on yer list but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope then they visited the apothecary which was fascinating enough to make up 80 diagon alley for its horrible smell a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor jars of herbs dried roots and bright powders lined the walls bundles of feathers strings of fangs and snarled claws hung from the ceiling while hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for harry harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twentyone galleons each and minuscule glitteryblack beetle eyes five knuts a scoop outside the apothecary hagrid checked harrys list again just yer wand left oh yeah an i still havent got yeh a birthday present harry felt himself go red you dont have to i know i dont have to tell yeh what ill get yer animal not a toad toads went outta fashion years ago yehd be laughed at an i don like cats they make me sneeze ill get yer an owl all the kids want owls theyre dead useful carry yer mail an everythin twenty minutes later they left eeylops owl emporium which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering jewelbright eyes harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl fast asleep with her head under her wing he couldnt stop stammering his thanks sounding just like professor quirrell don mention it said hagrid gruffly don expect youve had a lotta presents from them dursleys just ollivanders left now only place fer wands ollivanders and yeh gotta have the best wand a magic wand this was what harry had been really looking forward to 81 chapter five the last shop was narrow and shabby peeling gold letters over the door read ollivanders makers of fine wands since 382 bc a single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window a tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside it was a tiny place empty except for a single spindly chair that hagrid sat on to wait harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling for some reason the back of his neck prickled the very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic good afternoon said a soft voice harry jumped hagrid must have jumped too because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair an old man was standing before them his wide pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop hello said harry awkwardly ah yes said the man yes yes i thought id be seeing you soon harry potter it wasnt a question you have your mothers eyes it seems only yesterday she was in here herself buying her first wand ten and a quarter inches long swishy made of willow nice wand for charm work mr ollivander moved closer to harry harry wished he would blink those silvery eyes were a bit creepy your father on the other hand favored a mahogany wand eleven inches pliable a little more power and excellent for transfiguration well i say your father favored it its really the wand that chooses the wizard of course 82 diagon alley mr ollivander had come so close that he and harry were almost nose to nose harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes and thats where mr ollivander touched the lightning scar on harrys forehead with a long white finger im sorry to say i sold the wand that did it he said softly thirteenandahalf inches yew powerful wand very powerful and in the wrong hands well if id known what that wand was going out into the world to do he shook his head and then to harrys relief spotted hagrid rubeus rubeus hagrid how nice to see you again oak sixteen inches rather bendy wasnt it it was sir yes said hagrid good wand that one but i suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled said mr ollivander suddenly stern er yes they did yes said hagrid shuffling his feet ive still got the pieces though he added brightly but you dont use them said mr ollivander sharply oh no sir said hagrid quickly harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke hmmm said mr ollivander giving hagrid a piercing look well now mr potter let me see he pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket which is your wand arm er well im righthanded said harry hold out your arm thats it he measured harry from shoulder to finger then wrist to elbow shoulder to floor knee to armpit and round his head as he measured he said every ollivander 83 chapter five wand has a core of a powerful magical substance mr potter we use unicorn hairs phoenix tail feathers and the heartstrings of dragons no two ollivander wands are the same just as no two unicorns dragons or phoenixes are quite the same and of course you will never get such good results with another wizards wand harry suddenly realized that the tape measure which was measuring between his nostrils was doing this on its own mr ollivander was flitting around the shelves taking down boxes that will do he said and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor right then mr potter try this one beechwood and dragon heartstring nine inches nice and flexible just take it and give it a wave harry took the wand and feeling foolish waved it around a bit but mr ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once maple and phoenix feather seven inches quite whippy try harry tried but he had hardly raised the wand when it too was snatched back by mr ollivander no no here ebony and unicorn hair eight and a half inches springy go on go on try it out harry tried and tried he had no idea what mr ollivander was waiting for the pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair but the more wands mr ollivander pulled from the shelves the happier he seemed to become tricky customer eh not to worry well find the perfect match here somewhere i wonder now yes why not unusual combination holly and phoenix feather eleven inches nice and supple 84 diagon alley harry took the wand he felt a sudden warmth in his fingers he raised the wand above his head brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls hagrid whooped and clapped and mr ollivander cried oh bravo yes indeed oh very good well well well how curious how very curious he put harrys wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper still muttering curious curious sorry said harry but whats curious mr ollivander fixed harry with his pale stare i remember every wand ive ever sold mr potter every single wand it so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand gave another feather just one other it is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother why its brother gave you that scar harry swallowed yes thirteenandahalf inches yew curious indeed how these things happen the wand chooses the wizard remember i think we must expect great things from you mr potter after all hewhomustnotbenamed did great things terrible yes but great harry shivered he wasnt sure he liked mr ollivander too much he paid seven gold galleons for his wand and mr ollivander bowed them from his shop the late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as harry and hagrid made their way back down diagon alley back through the wall 85 chapter five back through the leaky cauldron now empty harry didnt speak at all as they walked down the road he didnt even notice how much people were gawking at them on the underground laden as they were with all their funnyshaped packages with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on harrys lap up another escalator out into paddington station harry only realized where they were when hagrid tapped him on the shoulder got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves he said he bought harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them harry kept looking around everything looked so strange somehow you all right harry yer very quiet said hagrid harry wasnt sure he could explain hed just had the best birthday of his life and yet he chewed his hamburger trying to find the words everyone thinks im special he said at last all those people in the leaky cauldron professor quirrell mr ollivander but i dont know anything about magic at all how can they expect great things im famous and i cant even remember what im famous for i dont know what happened when vol sorry i mean the night my parents died hagrid leaned across the table behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile don you worry harry youll learn fast enough everyone starts at the beginning at hogwarts youll be just fine just be yerself i know its hard yehve been singled out an thats always hard but yehll have a great time at hogwarts i did still do smatter of fact 86 diagon alley hagrid helped harry on to the train that would take him back to the dursleys then handed him an envelope yer ticket fer hogwarts he said first o september kings cross its all on yer ticket any problems with the dursleys send me a letter with yer owl shell know where to find me see yeh soon harry the train pulled out of the station harry wanted to watch hagrid until he was out of sight he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window but he blinked and hagrid had gone 87 chapter six the journey from platform nine and threequarters h arrys last month with the dursleys wasnt fun true dudley was now so scared of harry he wouldnt stay in the same room while aunt petunia and uncle vernon didnt shut harry in his cupboard force him to do anything or shout at him in fact they didnt speak to him at all half terrified half furious they acted as though any chair with harry in it were empty although this was an improvement in many ways it did become a bit depressing after a while harry kept to his room with his new owl for company he had decided to call her hedwig a name he had found in a history of magic his school books were very interesting he lay on his bed reading late into the night hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased it was lucky that aunt petunia didnt come in to vacuum anymore because hedwig kept bringing back dead mice every night before he went to sleep harry ticked off 88 the journey from platform nine and threequarters another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall counting down to september the first on the last day of august he thought hed better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to kings cross station the next day so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television he cleared his throat to let them know he was there and dudley screamed and ran from the room er uncle vernon uncle vernon grunted to show he was listening er i need to be at kings cross tomorrow to to go to hogwarts uncle vernon grunted again would it be all right if you gave me a lift grunt harry supposed that meant yes thank you he was about to go back upstairs when uncle vernon actually spoke funny way to get to a wizards school the train magic carpets all got punctures have they harry didnt say anything where is this school anyway i dont know said harry realizing this for the first time he pulled the ticket hagrid had given him out of his pocket i just take the train from platform nine and threequarters at eleven oclock he read his aunt and uncle stared platform what nine and threequarters 89 chapter six dont talk rubbish said uncle vernon there is no platform nine and threequarters its on my ticket barking said uncle vernon howling mad the lot of them youll see you just wait all right well take you to kings cross were going up to london tomorrow anyway or i wouldnt bother why are you going to london harry asked trying to keep things friendly taking dudley to the hospital growled uncle vernon got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to smeltings harry woke at five oclock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep he got up and pulled on his jeans because he didnt want to walk into the station in his wizards robes hed change on the train he checked his hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed saw that hedwig was shut safely in her cage and then paced the room waiting for the dursleys to get up two hours later harrys huge heavy trunk had been loaded into the dursleys car aunt petunia had talked dudley into sitting next to harry and they had set off they reached kings cross at half past ten uncle vernon dumped harrys trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him harry thought this was strangely kind until uncle vernon stopped dead facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face well there you are boy platform nine platform ten your platform should be somewhere in the middle but they dont seem to have built it yet do they 90 the journey from platform nine and threequarters he was quite right of course there was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it and in the middle nothing at all have a good term said uncle vernon with an even nastier smile he left without another word harry turned and saw the dursleys drive away all three of them were laughing harrys mouth went rather dry what on earth was he going to do he was starting to attract a lot of funny looks because of hedwig hed have to ask someone he stopped a passing guard but didnt dare mention platform nine and threequarters the guard had never heard of hogwarts and when harry couldnt even tell him what part of the country it was in he started to get annoyed as though harry was being stupid on purpose getting desperate harry asked for the train that left at eleven oclock but the guard said there wasnt one in the end the guard strode away muttering about time wasters harry was now trying hard not to panic according to the large clock over the arrivals board he had ten minutes left to get on the train to hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift a pocket full of wizard money and a large owl hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do like tapping the third brick on the left to get into diagon alley he wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspectors stand between platforms nine and ten at that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying packed with muggles of course 91 chapter six harry swung round the speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys all with flaming red hair each of them was pushing a trunk like harrys in front of him and they had an owl heart hammering harry pushed his cart after them they stopped and so did he just near enough to hear what they were saying now whats the platform number said the boys mother nine and threequarters piped a small girl also redheaded who was holding her hand mom cant i go youre not old enough ginny now be quiet all right percy you go first what looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten harry watched careful not to blink in case he missed it but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away the boy had vanished fred you next the plump woman said im not fred im george said the boy honestly woman you call yourself our mother cant you tell im george sorry george dear only joking i am fred said the boy and off he went his twin called after him to hurry up and he must have done so because a second later he had gone but how had he done it now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there and then quite suddenly he wasnt anywhere 92 the journey from platform nine and threequarters there was nothing else for it excuse me harry said to the plump woman hello dear she said first time at hogwarts rons new too she pointed at the last and youngest of her sons he was tall thin and gangling with freckles big hands and feet and a long nose yes said harry the thing is the thing is i dont know how to how to get onto the platform she said kindly and harry nodded not to worry she said all you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten dont stop and dont be scared youll crash into it thats very important best do it at a bit of a run if youre nervous go on go now before ron er okay said harry he pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier it looked very solid he started to walk toward it people jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten harry walked more quickly he was going to smash right into that barrier and then hed be in trouble leaning forward on his cart he broke into a heavy run the barrier was coming nearer and nearer he wouldnt be able to stop the cart was out of control he was a foot away he closed his eyes ready for the crash it didnt come he kept on running he opened his eyes a scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people a sign overhead said hogwarts express eleven oclock harry looked behind him and saw a wroughtiron archway 93 chapter six where the barrier had been with the words platform nine and threequarters on it he had done it smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks the first few carriages were already packed with students some hanging out of the window to talk to their families some fighting over seats harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat he passed a roundfaced boy who was saying gran ive lost my toad again oh neville he heard the old woman sigh a boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd give us a look lee go on the boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long hairy leg harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train he put hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door he tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot want a hand it was one of the redhaired twins hed followed through the barrier yes please harry panted oy fred cmere and help with the twins help harrys trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment 94 the journey from platform nine and threequarters thanks said harry pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes whats that said one of the twins suddenly pointing at harrys lightning scar blimey said the other twin are you he is said the first twin arent you he added to harry what said harry harry potter chorused the twins oh him said harry i mean yes i am the two boys gawked at him and harry felt himself turning red then to his relief a voice came floating in through the trains open door fred george are you there coming mom with a last look at harry the twins hopped off the train harry sat down next to the window where half hidden he could watch the redhaired family on the platform and hear what they were saying their mother had just taken out her handkerchief ron youve got something on your nose the youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose mom geroff he wriggled free aaah has ickle ronnie got somefink on his nosie said one of the twins shut up said ron wheres percy said their mother hes coming now the oldest boy came striding into sight he had already changed 95 chapter six into his billowing black hogwarts robes and harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge on his chest with the letter p on it cant stay long mother he said im up front the prefects have got two compartments to themselves oh are you a prefect percy said one of the twins with an air of great surprise you should have said something we had no idea hang on i think i remember him saying something about it said the other twin once or twice a minute all summer oh shut up said percy the prefect how come percy gets new robes anyway said one of the twins because hes a prefect said their mother fondly all right dear well have a good term send me an owl when you get there she kissed percy on the cheek and he left then she turned to the twins now you two this year you behave yourselves if i get one more owl telling me youve youve blown up a toilet or blown up a toilet weve never blown up a toilet great idea though thanks mom its not funny and look after ron dont worry ickle ronniekins is safe with us shut up said ron again he was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it hey mom guess what guess who we just met on the train 96 the journey from platform nine and threequarters harry leaned back quickly so they couldnt see him looking you know that blackhaired boy who was near us in the station know who he is who harry potter harry heard the little girls voice oh mom can i go on the train and see him mom oh please youve already seen him ginny and the poor boy isnt something you goggle at in a zoo is he really fred how do you know asked him saw his scar its really there like lightning poor dear no wonder he was alone i wondered he was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform never mind that do you think he remembers what youknowwho looks like their mother suddenly became very stern i forbid you to ask him fred no dont you dare as though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school all right keep your hair on a whistle sounded hurry up their mother said and the three boys clambered onto the train they leaned out of the window for her to kiss them goodbye and their younger sister began to cry dont ginny well send you loads of owls well send you a hogwarts toilet seat george only joking mom the train began to move harry saw the boys mother waving 97 chapter six and their sister half laughing half crying running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed then she fell back and waved harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner houses flashed past the window harry felt a great leap of excitement he didnt know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind the door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in anyone sitting there he asked pointing at the seat opposite harry everywhere else is full harry shook his head and the boy sat down he glanced at harry and then looked quickly out of the window pretending he hadnt looked harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose hey ron the twins were back listen were going down the middle of the train lee jordans got a giant tarantula down there right mumbled ron harry said the other twin did we introduce ourselves fred and george weasley and this is ron our brother see you later then bye said harry and ron the twins slid the compartment door shut behind them are you really harry potter ron blurted out harry nodded oh well i thought it might be one of fred and georges jokes said ron and have you really got you know 98 the journey from platform nine and threequarters he pointed at harrys forehead harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar ron stared so thats where youknowwho yes said harry but i cant remember it nothing said ron eagerly well i remember a lot of green light but nothing else wow said ron he sat and stared at harry for a few moments then as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing he looked quickly out of the window again are all your family wizards asked harry who found ron just as interesting as ron found him er yes i think so said ron i think moms got a second cousin whos an accountant but we never talk about him so you must know loads of magic already the weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in diagon alley had talked about i heard you went to live with muggles said ron what are they like horrible well not all of them my aunt and uncle and cousin are though wish id had three wizard brothers five said ron for some reason he was looking gloomy im the sixth in our family to go to hogwarts you could say ive got a lot to live up to bill and charlie have already left bill was head boy and charlie was captain of quidditch now percys a prefect fred and george mess around a lot but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks theyre really funny everyone expects me to do as well as the others but if i do its no big deal because 99 chapter six they did it first you never get anything new either with five brothers ive got bills old robes charlies old wand and percys old rat ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat which was asleep his names scabbers and hes useless he hardly ever wakes up percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect but they couldnt aff i mean i got scabbers instead rons ears went pink he seemed to think hed said too much because he went back to staring out of the window harry didnt think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl after all hed never had any money in his life until a month ago and he told ron so all about having to wear dudleys old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents this seemed to cheer ron up and until hagrid told me i didnt know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or voldemort ron gasped what said harry you said youknowwhos name said ron sounding both shocked and impressed id have thought you of all people im not trying to be brave or anything saying the name said harry i just never knew you shouldnt see what i mean ive got loads to learn i bet he added voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately i bet im the worst in the class you wont be theres loads of people who come from muggle families and they learn quick enough while they had been talking the train had carried them out of london now they were speeding past fields full of cows and 100 the journey from platform nine and threequarters sheep they were quiet for a time watching the fields and lanes flick past around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling dimpled woman slid back their door and said anything off the cart dears harry who hadnt had any breakfast leapt to his feet but rons ears went pink again and he muttered that hed brought sandwiches harry went out into the corridor he had never had any money for candy with the dursleys and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many mars bars as he could carry but the woman didnt have mars bars what she did have were bertie botts every flavor beans droobles best blowing gum chocolate frogs pumpkin pasties cauldron cakes licorice wands and a number of other strange things harry had never seen in his life not wanting to miss anything he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver sickles and seven bronze knuts ron stared as harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat hungry are you starving said harry taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it there were four sandwiches inside he pulled one of them apart and said she always forgets i dont like corned beef swap you for one of these said harry holding up a pasty go on you dont want this its all dry said ron she hasnt got much time he added quickly you know with five of us 101 chapter six go on have a pasty said harry who had never had anything to share before or indeed anyone to share it with it was a nice feeling sitting there with ron eating their way through all harrys pasties cakes and candies the sandwiches lay forgotten what are these harry asked ron holding up a pack of chocolate frogs theyre not really frogs are they he was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him no said ron but see what the card is im missing agrippa what oh of course you wouldnt know chocolate frogs have cards inside them you know to collect famous witches and wizards ive got about five hundred but i havent got agrippa or ptolemy harry unwrapped his chocolate frog and picked up the card it showed a mans face he wore halfmoon glasses had a long crooked nose and flowing silver hair beard and mustache underneath the picture was the name albus dumbledore so this is dumbledore said harry dont tell me youd never heard of dumbledore said ron can i have a frog i might get agrippa thanks harry turned over his card and read albus dumbledore currently headmaster of hogwarts considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the 102 the journey from platform nine and threequarters dark wizard grindelwald in 1945 for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamel professor dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling harry turned the card back over and saw to his astonishment that dumbledores face had disappeared hes gone well you cant expect him to hang around all day said ron hell be back no ive got morgana again and ive got about six of her do you want it you can start collecting rons eyes strayed to the pile of chocolate frogs waiting to be unwrapped help yourself said harry but in you know the muggle world people just stay put in photos do they what they dont move at all ron sounded amazed weird harry stared as dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the famous witches and wizards cards but harry couldnt keep his eyes off them soon he had not only dumbledore and morgana but hengist of woodcraft alberic grunnion circe paracelsus and merlin he finally tore his eyes away from the druidess cliodna who was scratching her nose to open a bag of bertie botts every flavor beans you want to be careful with those ron warned harry when they say every flavor they mean every flavor you know you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar 103 chapter six malade but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe george reckons he had a boogerflavored one once ron picked up a green bean looked at it carefully and bit into a corner bleaaargh see sprouts they had a good time eating the every flavor beans harry got toast coconut baked bean strawberry curry grass coffee sardine and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one ron wouldnt touch which turned out to be pepper the countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder the neat fields had gone now there were woods twisting rivers and dark green hills there was a knock on the door of their compartment and the roundfaced boy harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in he looked tearful sorry he said but have you seen a toad at all when they shook their heads he wailed ive lost him he keeps getting away from me hell turn up said harry yes said the boy miserably well if you see him he left dont know why hes so bothered said ron if id brought a toad id lose it as quick as i could mind you i brought scabbers so i cant talk the rat was still snoozing on rons lap he might have died and you wouldnt know the difference said ron in disgust i tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting but the spell didnt work ill show you look 104 the journey from platform nine and threequarters he rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very batteredlooking wand it was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end unicorn hairs nearly poking out anyway he had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again the toadless boy was back but this time he had a girl with him she was already wearing her new hogwarts robes has anyone seen a toad nevilles lost one she said she had a bossy sort of voice lots of bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth weve already told him we havent seen it said ron but the girl wasnt listening she was looking at the wand in his hand oh are you doing magic lets see it then she sat down ron looked taken aback er all right he cleared his throat sunshine daisies butter mellow turn this stupid fat rat yellow he waved his wand but nothing happened scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep are you sure thats a real spell said the girl well its not very good is it ive tried a few simple spells just for practice and its all worked for me nobody in my familys magic at all it was ever such a surprise when i got my letter but i was ever so pleased of course i mean its the very best school of witchcraft there is ive heard ive learned all our course books by heart of course i just hope it 105 chapter six will be enough im hermione granger by the way who are you she said all this very fast harry looked at ron and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadnt learned all the course books by heart either im ron weasley ron muttered harry potter said harry are you really said hermione i know all about you of course i got a few extra books for background reading and youre in modern magical history and the rise and fall of the dark arts and great wizarding events of the twentieth century am i said harry feeling dazed goodness didnt you know id have found out everything i could if it was me said hermione do either of you know what house youll be in ive been asking around and i hope im in gryffindor it sounds by far the best i hear dumbledore himself was in it but i suppose ravenclaw wouldnt be too bad anyway wed better go and look for nevilles toad you two had better change you know i expect well be there soon and she left taking the toadless boy with her whatever house im in i hope shes not in it said ron he threw his wand back into his trunk stupid spell george gave it to me bet he knew it was a dud what house are your brothers in asked harry gryffindor said ron gloom seemed to be settling on him again mom and dad were in it too i dont know what theyll say if im not i dont suppose ravenclaw would be too bad but imagine if they put me in slytherin 106 the journey from platform nine and threequarters thats the house vol i mean youknowwho was in yeah said ron he flopped back into his seat looking depressed you know i think the ends of scabbers whiskers are a bit lighter said harry trying to take rons mind off houses so what do your oldest brothers do now that theyve left anyway harry was wondering what a wizard did once hed finished school charlies in romania studying dragons and bills in africa doing something for gringotts said ron did you hear about gringotts its been all over the daily prophet but i dont suppose you get that with the muggles someone tried to rob a high security vault harry stared really what happened to them nothing thats why its such big news they havent been caught my dad says it mustve been a powerful dark wizard to get round gringotts but they dont think they took anything thats whats odd course everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case youknowwhos behind it harry turned this news over in his mind he was starting to get a prickle of fear every time youknowwho was mentioned he supposed this was all part of entering the magical world but it had been a lot more comfortable saying voldemort without worrying whats your quidditch team ron asked er i dont know any harry confessed what ron looked dumbfounded oh you wait its the best 107 chapter six game in the world and he was off explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players describing famous games hed been to with his brothers and the broomstick hed like to get if he had the money he was just taking harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again but it wasnt neville the toadless boy or hermione granger this time three boys entered and harry recognized the middle one at once it was the pale boy from madam malkins robe shop he was looking at harry with a lot more interest than hed shown back in diagon alley is it true he said theyre saying all down the train that harry potters in this compartment so its you is it yes said harry he was looking at the other boys both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean standing on either side of the pale boy they looked like bodyguards oh this is crabbe and this is goyle said the pale boy carelessly noticing where harry was looking and my names malfoy draco malfoy ron gave a slight cough which might have been hiding a snigger draco malfoy looked at him think my names funny do you no need to ask who you are my father told me all the weasleys have red hair freckles and more children than they can afford he turned back to harry youll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others potter you dont want to go making friends with the wrong sort i can help you there he held out his hand to shake harrys but harry didnt take it 108 the journey from platform nine and threequarters i think i can tell who the wrong sort are for myself thanks he said coolly draco malfoy didnt go red but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks id be careful if i were you potter he said slowly unless youre a bit politer youll go the same way as your parents they didnt know what was good for them either you hang around with riffraff like the weasleys and that hagrid and itll rub off on you both harry and ron stood up say that again ron said his face as red as his hair oh youre going to fight us are you malfoy sneered unless you get out now said harry more bravely than he felt because crabbe and goyle were a lot bigger than him or ron but we dont feel like leaving do we boys weve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some goyle reached toward the chocolate frogs next to ron ron leapt forward but before hed so much as touched goyle goyle let out a horrible yell scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger sharp little teeth sunk deep into goyles knuckle crabbe and malfoy backed away as goyle swung scabbers round and round howling and when scabbers finally flew off and hit the window all three of them disappeared at once perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets or perhaps theyd heard footsteps because a second later hermione granger had come in what has been going on she said looking at the sweets all over the floor and ron picking up scabbers by his tail i think hes been knocked out ron said to harry he looked 109 chapter six closer at scabbers no i dont believe it hes gone back to sleep and so he had youve met malfoy before harry explained about their meeting in diagon alley ive heard of his family said ron darkly they were some of the first to come back to our side after youknowwho disappeared said theyd been bewitched my dad doesnt believe it he says malfoys father didnt need an excuse to go over to the dark side he turned to hermione can we help you with something youd better hurry up and put your robes on ive just been up to the front to ask the conductor and he says were nearly there you havent been fighting have you youll be in trouble before we even get there scabbers has been fighting not us said ron scowling at her would you mind leaving while we change all right i only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly racing up and down the corridors said hermione in a sniffy voice and youve got dirt on your nose by the way did you know ron glared at her as she left harry peered out of the window it was getting dark he could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky the train did seem to be slowing down he and ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes rons were a bit short for him you could see his sneakers underneath them a voice echoed through the train we will be reaching hog 110 the journey from platform nine and threequarters warts in five minutes time please leave your luggage on the train it will be taken to the school separately harrys stomach lurched with nerves and ron he saw looked pale under his freckles they crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor the train slowed right down and finally stopped people pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny dark platform harry shivered in the cold night air then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students and harry heard a familiar voice firs years firs years over here all right there harry hagrids big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads cmon follow me any more firs years mind yer step now firs years follow me slipping and stumbling they followed hagrid down what seemed to be a steep narrow path it was so dark on either side of them that harry thought there must be thick trees there nobody spoke much neville the boy who kept losing his toad sniffed once or twice yehll get yer firs sight o hogwarts in a sec hagrid called over his shoulder jus round this bend here there was a loud oooooh the narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake perched atop a high mountain on the other side its windows sparkling in the starry sky was a vast castle with many turrets and towers no moren four to a boat hagrid called pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore harry and ron were followed into their boat by neville and hermione 111 chapter six everyone in shouted hagrid who had a boat to himself right then forward and the fleet of little boats moved off all at once gliding across the lake which was as smooth as glass everyone was silent staring up at the great castle overhead it towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood heads down yelled hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face they were carried along a dark tunnel which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle until they reached a kind of underground harbor where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles oy you there is this your toad said hagrid who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them trevor cried neville blissfully holding out his hands then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after hagrids lamp coming out at last onto smooth damp grass right in the shadow of the castle they walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge oak front door everyone here you there still got yer toad hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door 112 chapter seven the sorting hat t he door swung open at once a tall blackhaired witch in emeraldgreen robes stood there she had a very stern face and harrys first thought was that this was not someone to cross the firs years professor mcgonagall said hagrid thank you hagrid i will take them from here she pulled the door wide the entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the dursleys house in it the stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at gringotts the ceiling was too high to make out and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors they followed professor mcgonagall across the flagged stone floor harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right the rest of the school must already be here but professor mcgonagall showed the first years into a small empty chamber off the hall they crowded in standing 113 chapter seven rather closer together than they would usually have done peering about nervously welcome to hogwarts said professor mcgonagall the startofterm banquet will begin shortly but before you take your seats in the great hall you will be sorted into your houses the sorting is a very important ceremony because while you are here your house will be something like your family within hogwarts you will have classes with the rest of your house sleep in your house dormitory and spend free time in your house common room the four houses are called gryffindor hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards while you are at hogwarts your triumphs will earn your house points while any rulebreaking will lose house points at the end of the year the house with the most points is awarded the house cup a great honor i hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours the sorting ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school i suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting her eyes lingered for a moment on nevilles cloak which was fastened under his left ear and on rons smudged nose harry nervously tried to flatten his hair i shall return when we are ready for you said professor mcgonagall please wait quietly she left the chamber harry swallowed how exactly do they sort us into houses he asked ron 114 the sorting hat some sort of test i think fred said it hurts a lot but i think he was joking harrys heart gave a horrible jolt a test in front of the whole school but he didnt know any magic yet what on earth would he have to do he hadnt expected something like this the moment they arrived he looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified too no one was talking much except hermione granger who was whispering very fast about all the spells shed learned and wondering which one shed need harry tried hard not to listen to her hed never been more nervous never not even when hed had to take a school report home to the dursleys saying that hed somehow turned his teachers wig blue he kept his eyes fixed on the door any second now professor mcgonagall would come back and lead him to his doom then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air several people behind him screamed what the he gasped so did the people around him about twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall pearlywhite and slightly transparent they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years they seemed to be arguing what looked like a fat little monk was saying forgive and forget i say we ought to give him a second chance my dear friar havent we given peeves all the chances he deserves he gives us all a bad name and you know hes not really even a ghost i say what are you all doing here a ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years 115 chapter seven nobody answered new students said the fat friar smiling around at them about to be sorted i suppose a few people nodded mutely hope to see you in hufflepuff said the friar my old house you know move along now said a sharp voice the sorting ceremonys about to start professor mcgonagall had returned one by one the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall now form a line professor mcgonagall told the first years and follow me feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair with ron behind him and they walked out of the chamber back across the hall and through a pair of double doors into the great hall harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place it was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables where the rest of the students were sitting these tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets at the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting professor mcgonagall led the first years up here so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students with the teachers behind them the hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight dotted here and there among the students the ghosts shone misty silver mainly to avoid all the staring eyes harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars he heard 116 the sorting hat hermione whisper its bewitched to look like the sky outside i read about it in hogwarts a history it was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all and that the great hall didnt simply open on to the heavens harry quickly looked down again as professor mcgonagall silently placed a fourlegged stool in front of the first years on top of the stool she put a pointed wizards hat this hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty aunt petunia wouldnt have let it in the house maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it harry thought wildly that seemed the sort of thing noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat he stared at it too for a few seconds there was complete silence then the hat twitched a rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth and the hat began to sing oh you may not think im pretty but dont judge on what you see ill eat myself if you can find a smarter hat than me you can keep your bowlers black your top hats sleek and tall for im the hogwarts sorting hat and i can cap them all theres nothing hidden in your head the sorting hat cant see so try me on and i will tell you where you ought to be 117 chapter seven you might belong in gryffindor where dwell the brave at heart their daring nerve and chivalry set gryffindors apart you might belong in hufflepuff where they are just and loyal those patient hufflepuffs are true and unafraid of toil or yet in wise old ravenclaw if youve a ready mind where those of wit and learning will always find their kind or perhaps in slytherin youll make your real friends those cunning folk use any means to achieve their ends so put me on dont be afraid and dont get in a flap youre in safe hands though i have none for im a thinking cap the whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song it bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again so weve just got to try on the hat ron whispered to harry ill kill fred he was going on about wrestling a troll harry smiled weakly yes trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching the hat seemed to be asking rather a 118 the sorting hat lot harry didnt feel brave or quickwitted or any of it at the moment if only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy that would have been the one for him professor mcgonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment when i call your name you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted she said abbott hannah a pinkfaced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line put on the hat which fell right down over her eyes and sat down a moments pause hufflepuff shouted the hat the table on the right cheered and clapped as hannah went to sit down at the hufflepuff table harry saw the ghost of the fat friar waving merrily at her bones susan hufflepuff shouted the hat again and susan scuttled off to sit next to hannah boot terry ravenclaw the table second from the left clapped this time several ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with terry as he joined them brocklehurst mandy went to ravenclaw too but brown lavender became the first new gryffindor and the table on the far left exploded with cheers harry could see rons twin brothers catcalling bulstrode millicent then became a slytherin perhaps it was harrys imagination after all hed heard about slytherin but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot 119 chapter seven he was starting to feel definitely sick now he remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school he had always been last to be chosen not because he was no good but because no one wanted dudley to think they liked him finchfletchley justin hufflepuff sometimes harry noticed the hat shouted out the house at once but at others it took a little while to decide finnigan seamus the sandyhaired boy next to harry in the line sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a gryffindor granger hermione hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head gryffindor shouted the hat ron groaned a horrible thought struck harry as horrible thoughts always do when youre very nervous what if he wasnt chosen at all what if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages until professor mcgonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and hed better get back on the train when neville longbottom the boy who kept losing his toad was called he fell over on his way to the stool the hat took a long time to decide with neville when it finally shouted gryffindor neville ran off still wearing it and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to macdougal morag malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed slytherin 120 the sorting hat malfoy went to join his friends crabbe and goyle looking pleased with himself there werent many people left now moon nott parkinson then a pair of twin girls patil and patil then perks sallyanne and then at last potter harry as harry stepped forward whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall potter did she say the harry potter the last thing harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat he waited hmm said a small voice in his ear difficult very difficult plenty of courage i see not a bad mind either theres talent oh my goodness yes and a nice thirst to prove yourself now thats interesting so where shall i put you harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought not slytherin not slytherin not slytherin eh said the small voice are you sure you could be great you know its all here in your head and slytherin will help you on the way to greatness no doubt about that no well if youre sure better be gryffindor harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall he took off the hat and walked shakily toward the gryffindor table he was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in slytherin he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet percy the 121 chapter seven prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously while the weasley twins yelled we got potter we got potter harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff hed seen earlier the ghost patted his arm giving harry the sudden horrible feeling hed just plunged it into a bucket of icecold water he could see the high table properly now at the end nearest him sat hagrid who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up harry grinned back and there in the center of the high table in a large gold chair sat albus dumbledore harry recognized him at once from the card hed gotten out of the chocolate frog on the train dumbledores silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts harry spotted professor quirrell too the nervous young man from the leaky cauldron he was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban and now there were only four people left to be sorted thomas dean a black boy even taller than ron joined harry at the gryffindor table turpin lisa became a ravenclaw and then it was rons turn he was pale green by now harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted gryffindor harry clapped loudly with the rest as ron collapsed into the chair next to him well done ron excellent said percy weasley pompously across harry as zabini blaise was made a slytherin professor mcgonagall rolled up her scroll and took the sorting hat away harry looked down at his empty gold plate he had only just realized how hungry he was the pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago 122 the sorting hat albus dumbledore had gotten to his feet he was beaming at the students his arms opened wide as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there welcome he said welcome to a new year at hogwarts before we begin our banquet i would like to say a few words and here they are nitwit blubber oddment tweak thank you he sat back down everybody clapped and cheered harry didnt know whether to laugh or not is he a bit mad he asked percy uncertainly mad said percy airily hes a genius best wizard in the world but he is a bit mad yes potatoes harry harrys mouth fell open the dishes in front of him were now piled with food he had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table roast beef roast chicken pork chops and lamb chops sausages bacon and steak boiled potatoes roast potatoes fries yorkshire pudding peas carrots gravy ketchup and for some strange reason peppermint humbugs the dursleys had never exactly starved harry but hed never been allowed to eat as much as he liked dudley had always taken anything that harry really wanted even if it made him sick harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat it was all delicious that does look good said the ghost in the ruff sadly watching harry cut up his steak cant you i havent eaten for nearly five hundred years said the ghost i dont need to of course but one does miss it i dont think ive in 123 chapter seven troduced myself sir nicholas de mimsyporpington at your service resident ghost of gryffindor tower i know who you are said ron suddenly my brothers told me about you youre nearly headless nick i would prefer you to call me sir nicholas de mimsy the ghost began stiffly but sandyhaired seamus finnigan interrupted nearly headless how can you be nearly headless sir nicholas looked extremely miffed as if their little chat wasnt going at all the way he wanted like this he said irritably he seized his left ear and pulled his whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge someone had obviously tried to behead him but not done it properly looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces nearly headless nick flipped his head back onto his neck coughed and said so new gryffindors i hope youre going to help us win the house championship this year gryffindors have never gone so long without winning slytherins have got the cup six years in a row the bloody barons becoming almost unbearable hes the slytherin ghost harry looked over at the slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there with blank staring eyes a gaunt face and robes stained with silver blood he was right next to malfoy who harry was pleased to see didnt look too pleased with the seating arrangements how did he get covered in blood asked seamus with great interest ive never asked said nearly headless nick delicately when everyone had eaten as much as they could the remains of the food faded from the plates leaving them sparkling clean as be 124 the sorting hat fore a moment later the desserts appeared blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of apple pies treacle tarts chocolate clairs and jam doughnuts trifle strawberries jello rice pudding as harry helped himself to a treacle tart the talk turned to their families im halfandhalf said seamus me dads a muggle mom didnt tell him she was a witch til after they were married bit of a nasty shock for him the others laughed what about you neville said ron well my gran brought me up and shes a witch said neville but the family thought i was allmuggle for ages my great uncle algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me he pushed me off the end of blackpool pier once i nearly drowned but nothing happened until i was eight great uncle algie came round for dinner and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my great auntie enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go but i bounced all the way down the garden and into the road they were all really pleased gran was crying she was so happy and you should have seen their faces when i got in here they thought i might not be magic enough to come you see great uncle algie was so pleased he bought me my toad on harrys other side percy weasley and hermione were talking about lessons i do hope they start right away theres so much to learn im particularly interested in transfiguration you know turning something into something else of course its supposed to 125 chapter seven be very difficult youll be starting small just matches into needles and that sort of thing harry who was starting to feel warm and sleepy looked up at the high table again hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet professor mcgonagall was talking to professor dumbledore professor quirrell in his absurd turban was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair a hooked nose and sallow skin it happened very suddenly the hooknosed teacher looked past quirrells turban straight into harrys eyes and a sharp hot pain shot across the scar on harrys forehead ouch harry clapped a hand to his head what is it asked percy nnothing the pain had gone as quickly as it had come harder to shake off was the feeling harry had gotten from the teachers look a feeling that he didnt like harry at all whos that teacher talking to professor quirrell he asked percy oh you know quirrell already do you no wonder hes looking so nervous thats professor snape he teaches potions but he doesnt want to everyone knows hes after quirrells job knows an awful lot about the dark arts snape harry watched snape for a while but snape didnt look at him again at last the desserts too disappeared and professor dumbledore got to his feet again the hall fell silent ahem just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered i have a few startofterm notices to give you 126 the sorting hat first years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils and a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well dumbledores twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the weasley twins i have also been asked by mr filch the caretaker to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact madam hooch and finally i must tell you that this year the thirdfloor corridor on the righthand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death harry laughed but he was one of the few who did hes not serious he muttered to percy must be said percy frowning at dumbledore its odd because he usually gives us a reason why were not allowed to go somewhere the forests full of dangerous beasts everyone knows that i do think he might have told us prefects at least and now before we go to bed let us sing the school song cried dumbledore harry noticed that the other teachers smiles had become rather fixed dumbledore gave his wand a little flick as if he was trying to get a fly off the end and a long golden ribbon flew out of it which rose high above the tables and twisted itself snakelike into words everyone pick their favorite tune said dumbledore and off we go 127 chapter seven and the school bellowed hogwarts hogwarts hoggy warty hogwarts teach us something please whether we be old and bald or young with scabby knees our heads could do with filling with some interesting stuff for now theyre bare and full of air dead flies and bits of fluff so teach us things worth knowing bring back what weve forgot just do your best well do the rest and learn until our brains all rot everybody finished the song at different times at last only the weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished he was one of those who clapped loudest ah music he said wiping his eyes a magic beyond all we do here and now bedtime off you trot the gryffindor first years followed percy through the chattering crowds out of the great hall and up the marble staircase harrys legs were like lead again but only because he was so tired and full of food he was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed or that twice percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries they climbed more 128 the sorting hat staircases yawning and dragging their feet and harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt a bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them and as percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him peeves percy whispered to the first years a poltergeist he raised his voice peeves show yourself a loud rude sound like the air being let out of a balloon answered do you want me to go to the bloody baron there was a pop and a little man with wicked dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared floating crosslegged in the air clutching the walking sticks oooooooh he said with an evil cackle ickle firsties what fun he swooped suddenly at them they all ducked go away peeves or the baronll hear about this i mean it barked percy peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished dropping the walking sticks on nevilles head they heard him zooming away rattling coats of armor as he passed you want to watch out for peeves said percy as they set off again the bloody barons the only one who can control him he wont even listen to us prefects here we are at the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress password she said 129 chapter seven caput draconis said percy and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall they all scrambled through it neville needed a leg up and found themselves in the gryffindor common room a cozy round room full of squashy armchairs percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another at the top of a spiral staircase they were obviously in one of the towers they found their beds at last five fourposters hung with deep red velvet curtains their trunks had already been brought up too tired to talk much they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed great food isnt it ron muttered to harry through the hangings get off scabbers hes chewing my sheets harry was going to ask ron if hed had any of the treacle tart but he fell asleep almost at once perhaps harry had eaten a bit too much because he had a very strange dream he was wearing professor quirrells turban which kept talking to him telling him he must transfer to slytherin at once because it was his destiny harry told the turban he didnt want to be in slytherin it got heavier and heavier he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully and there was malfoy laughing at him as he struggled with it then malfoy turned into the hooknosed teacher snape whose laugh became high and cold there was a burst of green light and harry woke sweating and shaking he rolled over and fell asleep again and when he woke next day he didnt remember the dream at all 130 chapter eight the potions master t here look where next to the tall kid with the red hair wearing the glasses did you see his face did you see his scar whispers followed harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day people lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again staring harry wished they wouldnt because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes there were a hundred and fortytwo staircases at hogwarts wide sweeping ones narrow rickety ones some that led somewhere different on a friday some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump then there were doors that 131 chapter eight wouldnt open unless you asked politely or tickled them in exactly the right place and doors that werent really doors at all but solid walls just pretending it was also very hard to remember where anything was because it all seemed to move around a lot the people in the portraits kept going to visit each other and harry was sure the coats of armor could walk the ghosts didnt help either it was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open nearly headless nick was always happy to point new gryffindors in the right direction but peeves the poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class he would drop wastepaper baskets on your head pull rugs from under your feet pelt you with bits of chalk or sneak up behind you invisible grab your nose and screech got your conk even worse than peeves if that was possible was the caretaker argus filch harry and ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the outofbounds corridor on the third floor he wouldnt believe they were lost was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by professor quirrell who was passing filch owned a cat called mrs norris a scrawny dustcolored creature with bulging lamplike eyes just like filchs she patrolled the corridors alone break a rule in front of her put just one toe out of line and shed whisk off for filch whod appear wheezing two 132 the potions master seconds later filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone except perhaps the weasley twins and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts the students all hated him and it was the dearest ambition of many to give mrs norris a good kick and then once you had managed to find them there were the classes themselves there was a lot more to magic as harry quickly found out than waving your wand and saying a few funny words they had to study the night skies through their telescopes every wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study herbology with a dumpy little witch called professor sprout where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi and found out what they were used for easily the most boring class was history of magic which was the only one taught by a ghost professor binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach leaving his body behind him binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates and got emeric the evil and uric the oddball mixed up professor flitwick the charms teacher was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk at the start of their first class he took the roll call and when he reached harrys name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight professor mcgonagall was again different harry had been quite right to think she wasnt a teacher to cross strict and clever she gave them a talkingto the moment they sat down in her first class 133 chapter eight transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at hogwarts she said anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back you have been warned then she changed her desk into a pig and back again they were all very impressed and couldnt wait to get started but soon realized they werent going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time after taking a lot of complicated notes they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle by the end of the lesson only hermione granger had made any difference to her match professor mcgonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave hermione a rare smile the class everyone had really been looking forward to was defense against the dark arts but quirrells lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke his classroom smelled strongly of garlic which everyone said was to ward off a vampire hed met in romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days his turban he told them had been given to him by an african prince as a thankyou for getting rid of a troublesome zombie but they werent sure they believed this story for one thing when seamus finnigan asked eagerly to hear how quirrell had fought off the zombie quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather for another they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban and the weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well so that quirrell was protected wherever he went harry was very relieved to find out that he wasnt miles behind everyone else lots of people had come from muggle families and like him hadnt had any idea that they were witches and wizards 134 the potions master there was so much to learn that even people like ron didnt have much of a head start friday was an important day for harry and ron they finally managed to find their way down to the great hall for breakfast without getting lost once what have we got today harry asked ron as he poured sugar on his porridge double potions with the slytherins said ron snapes head of slytherin house they say he always favors them well be able to see if its true wish mcgonagall favored us said harry professor mcgonagall was head of gryffindor house but it hadnt stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before just then the mail arrived harry had gotten used to this by now but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the great hall during breakfast circling the tables until they saw their owners and dropping letters and packages onto their laps hedwig hadnt brought harry anything so far she sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls this morning however she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto harrys plate harry tore it open at once it said in a very untidy scrawl dear harry i know you get friday afternoons off so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three 135 chapter eight i want to hear all about your first week send us an answer back with hedwig hagrid harry borrowed rons quill scribbled yes please see you later on the back of the note and sent hedwig off again it was lucky that harry had tea with hagrid to look forward to because the potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far at the startofterm banquet harry had gotten the idea that professor snape disliked him by the end of the first potions lesson he knew hed been wrong snape didnt dislike harry he hated him potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons it was colder here than up in the main castle and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls snape like flitwick started the class by taking the roll call and like flitwick he paused at harrys name ah yes he said softly harry potter our new celebrity draco malfoy and his friends crabbe and goyle sniggered behind their hands snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class his eyes were black like hagrids but they had none of hagrids warmth they were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels you are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking he began he spoke in barely more than a whisper but they caught every word like professor mcgonagall snape had 136 the potions master the gift of keeping a class silent without effort as there is little foolish wandwaving here many of you will hardly believe this is magic i dont expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins bewitching the mind ensnaring the senses i can teach you how to bottle fame brew glory even stopper death if you arent as big a bunch of dunderheads as i usually have to teach more silence followed this little speech harry and ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows hermione granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasnt a dunderhead potter said snape suddenly what would i get if i added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood powdered root of what to an infusion of what harry glanced at ron who looked as stumped as he was hermiones hand had shot into the air i dont know sir said harry snapes lips curled into a sneer tut tut fame clearly isnt everything he ignored hermiones hand lets try again potter where would you look if i told you to find me a bezoar hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat but harry didnt have the faintest idea what a bezoar was he tried not to look at malfoy crabbe and goyle who were shaking with laughter i dont know sir 137 chapter eight thought you wouldnt open a book before coming eh potter harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes he had looked through his books at the dursleys but did snape expect him to remember everything in one thousand magical herbs and fungi snape was still ignoring hermiones quivering hand what is the difference potter between monkshood and wolfsbane at this hermione stood up her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling i dont know said harry quietly i think hermione does though why dont you try her a few people laughed harry caught seamuss eye and seamus winked snape however was not pleased sit down he snapped at hermione for your information potter asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the draught of living death a bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons as for monkshood and wolfsbane they are the same plant which also goes by the name of aconite well why arent you all copying that down there was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment over the noise snape said and a point will be taken from gryffindor house for your cheek potter things didnt improve for the gryffindors as the potions lesson continued snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils he swept around in his long black cloak watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs 138 the potions master criticizing almost everyone except malfoy whom he seemed to like he was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon neville had somehow managed to melt seamuss cauldron into a twisted blob and their potion was seeping across the stone floor burning holes in peoples shoes within seconds the whole class was standing on their stools while neville who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs idiot boy snarled snape clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand i suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose take him up to the hospital wing snape spat at seamus then he rounded on harry and ron who had been working next to neville you potter why didnt you tell him not to add the quills thought hed make you look good if he got it wrong did you thats another point youve lost for gryffindor this was so unfair that harry opened his mouth to argue but ron kicked him behind their cauldron dont push it he muttered ive heard snape can turn very nasty as they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later harrys mind was racing and his spirits were low hed lost two points for gryffindor in his very first week why did snape hate him so much 139 chapter eight cheer up said ron snapes always taking points off fred and george can i come and meet hagrid with you at five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest a crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door when harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks then hagrids voice rang out saying back fang back hagrids big hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open hang on he said back fang he let them in struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound there was only one room inside hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it make yerselves at home said hagrid letting go of fang who bounded straight at ron and started licking his ears like hagrid fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked this is ron harry told hagrid who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate another weasley eh said hagrid glancing at rons freckles i spent half me life chasin yer twin brothers away from the forest the rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth but harry and ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told hagrid all about their first lessons fang rested his head on harrys knee and drooled all over his robes 140 the potions master harry and ron were delighted to hear hagrid call filch that old git an as fer that cat mrs norris id like ter introduce her to fang sometime dyeh know every time i go up ter the school she follows me everywhere cant get rid of her filch puts her up to it harry told hagrid about snapes lesson hagrid like ron told harry not to worry about it that snape liked hardly any of the students but he seemed to really hate me rubbish said hagrid why should he yet harry couldnt help thinking that hagrid didnt quite meet his eyes when he said that hows yer brother charlie hagrid asked ron i liked him a lot great with animals harry wondered if hagrid had changed the subject on purpose while ron told hagrid all about charlies work with dragons harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy it was a cutting from the daily prophet gringotts breakin latest investigations continue into the breakin at gringotts on 31 july widely believed to be the work of dark wizards or witches unknown gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day but were not telling you what was in there so keep your noses out if you know whats good 141 chapter eight for you said a gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon harry remembered ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob gringotts but ron hadnt mentioned the date hagrid said harry that gringotts breakin happened on my birthday it mightve been happening while we were there there was no doubt about it hagrid definitely didnt meet harrys eyes this time he grunted and offered him another rock cake harry read the story again the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen if you could call it emptying taking out that grubby little package had that been what the thieves were looking for as harry and ron walked back to the castle for dinner their pockets weighed down with rock cakes theyd been too polite to refuse harry thought that none of the lessons hed had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with hagrid had hagrid collected that package just in time where was it now and did hagrid know something about snape that he didnt want to tell harry 142 chapter nine the midnight duel h arry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than dudley but that was before he met draco malfoy still firstyear gryffindors only had potions with the slytherins so they didnt have to put up with malfoy much or at least they didnt until they spotted a notice pinned up in the gryffindor common room that made them all groan flying lessons would be starting on thursday and gryffindor and slytherin would be learning together typical said harry darkly just what i always wanted to make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of malfoy he had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else you dont know that youll make a fool of yourself said ron reasonably anyway i know malfoys always going on about how good he is at quidditch but i bet thats all talk 143 chapter nine malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot he complained loudly about first years never getting on the house quidditch teams and told long boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping muggles in helicopters he wasnt the only one though the way seamus finnigan told it hed spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick even ron would tell anyone whod listen about the time hed almost hit a hang glider on charlies old broom everyone from wizarding families talked about quidditch constantly ron had already had a big argument with dean thomas who shared their dormitory about soccer ron couldnt see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly harry had caught ron prodding deans poster of west ham soccer team trying to make the players move neville had never been on a broomstick in his life because his grandmother had never let him near one privately harry felt shed had good reason because neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground hermione granger was almost as nervous about flying as neville was this was something you couldnt learn by heart out of a book not that she hadnt tried at breakfast on thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips shed gotten out of a library book called quidditch through the ages neville was hanging on to her every word desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later but everybody else was very pleased when hermiones lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail harry hadnt had a single letter since hagrids note something that malfoy had been quick to notice of course malfoys eagle owl 144 the midnight duel was always bringing him packages of sweets from home which he opened gloatingly at the slytherin table a barn owl brought neville a small package from his grandmother he opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble which seemed to be full of white smoke its a remembrall he explained gran knows i forget things this tells you if theres something youve forgotten to do look you hold it tight like this and if it turns red oh his face fell because the remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet youve forgotten something neville was trying to remember what hed forgotten when draco malfoy who was passing the gryffindor table snatched the remembrall out of his hand harry and ron jumped to their feet they were half hoping for a reason to fight malfoy but professor mcgonagall who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school was there in a flash whats going on malfoys got my remembrall professor scowling malfoy quickly dropped the remembrall back on the table just looking he said and he sloped away with crabbe and goyle behind him at threethirty that afternoon harry ron and the other gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson it was a clear breezy day and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a 145 chapter nine smooth flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance the slytherins were already there and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground harry had heard fred and george weasley complain about the school brooms saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high or always flew slightly to the left their teacher madam hooch arrived she had short gray hair and yellow eyes like a hawk well what are you all waiting for she barked everyone stand by a broomstick come on hurry up harry glanced down at his broom it was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles stick out your right hand over your broom called madam hooch at the front and say up up everyone shouted harrys broom jumped into his hand at once but it was one of the few that did hermione grangers had simply rolled over on the ground and nevilles hadnt moved at all perhaps brooms like horses could tell when you were afraid thought harry there was a quaver in nevilles voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground madam hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips harry and ron were delighted when she told malfoy hed been doing it wrong for years now when i blow my whistle you kick off from the ground hard said madam hooch keep your brooms steady rise a few 146 the midnight duel feet and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly on my whistle three two but neville nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground pushed off hard before the whistle had touched madam hoochs lips come back boy she shouted but neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle twelve feet twenty feet harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away saw him gasp slip sideways off the broom and wham a thud and a nasty crack and neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap his broomstick was still rising higher and higher and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight madam hooch was bending over neville her face as white as his broken wrist harry heard her mutter come on boy its all right up you get she turned to the rest of the class none of you is to move while i take this boy to the hospital wing you leave those brooms where they are or youll be out of hogwarts before you can say quidditch come on dear neville his face tearstreaked clutching his wrist hobbled off with madam hooch who had her arm around him no sooner were they out of earshot than malfoy burst into laughter did you see his face the great lump the other slytherins joined in shut up malfoy snapped parvati patil 147 chapter nine ooh sticking up for longbottom said pansy parkinson a hardfaced slytherin girl never thought youd like fat little crybabies parvati look said malfoy darting forward and snatching something out of the grass its that stupid thing longbottoms gran sent him the remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up give that here malfoy said harry quietly everyone stopped talking to watch malfoy smiled nastily i think ill leave it somewhere for longbottom to find how about up a tree give it here harry yelled but malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off he hadnt been lying he could fly well hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called come and get it potter harry grabbed his broom no shouted hermione granger madam hooch told us not to move youll get us all into trouble harry ignored her blood was pounding in his ears he mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up up he soared air rushed through his hair and his robes whipped out behind him and in a rush of fierce joy he realized hed found something he could do without being taught this was easy this was wonderful he pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from ron he turned his broomstick sharply to face malfoy in midair malfoy looked stunned 148 the midnight duel give it here harry called or ill knock you off that broom oh yeah said malfoy trying to sneer but looking worried harry knew somehow what to do he leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands and it shot toward malfoy like a javelin malfoy only just got out of the way in time harry made a sharp aboutface and held the broom steady a few people below were clapping no crabbe and goyle up here to save your neck malfoy harry called the same thought seemed to have struck malfoy catch it if you can then he shouted and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground harry saw as though in slow motion the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall he leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive racing the ball wind whistled in his ears mingled with the screams of people watching he stretched out his hand a foot from the ground he caught it just in time to pull his broom straight and he toppled gently onto the grass with the remembrall clutched safely in his fist harry potter his heart sank faster than hed just dived professor mcgonagall was running toward them he got to his feet trembling never in all my time at hogwarts professor mcgonagall was almost speechless with shock and her glasses flashed furiously how dare you might have broken your neck it wasnt his fault professor 149 chapter nine be quiet miss patil but malfoy thats enough mr weasley potter follow me now harry caught sight of malfoy crabbe and goyles triumphant faces as he left walking numbly in professor mcgonagalls wake as she strode toward the castle he was going to be expelled he just knew it he wanted to say something to defend himself but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice professor mcgonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him he had to jog to keep up now hed done it he hadnt even lasted two weeks hed be packing his bags in ten minutes what would the dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep up the front steps up the marble staircase inside and still professor mcgonagall didnt say a word to him she wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with harry trotting miserably behind her maybe she was taking him to dumbledore he thought of hagrid expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper perhaps he could be hagrids assistant his stomach twisted as he imagined it watching ron and the others becoming wizards while he stumped around the grounds carrying hagrids bag professor mcgonagall stopped outside a classroom she opened the door and poked her head inside excuse me professor flitwick could i borrow wood for a moment wood thought harry bewildered was wood a cane she was going to use on him but wood turned out to be a person a burly fifthyear boy who came out of flitwicks class looking confused 150 the midnight duel follow me you two said professor mcgonagall and they marched on up the corridor wood looking curiously at harry in here professor mcgonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for peeves who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard out peeves she barked peeves threw the chalk into a bin which clanged loudly and he swooped out cursing professor mcgonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys potter this is oliver wood wood ive found you a seeker woods expression changed from puzzlement to delight are you serious professor absolutely said professor mcgonagall crisply the boys a natural ive never seen anything like it was that your first time on a broomstick potter harry nodded silently he didnt have a clue what was going on but he didnt seem to be being expelled and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs he caught that thing in his hand after a fiftyfoot dive professor mcgonagall told wood didnt even scratch himself charlie weasley couldnt have done it wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once ever seen a game of quidditch potter he asked excitedly woods captain of the gryffindor team professor mcgonagall explained hes just the build for a seeker too said wood now walking 151 chapter nine around harry and staring at him light speedy well have to get him a decent broom professor a nimbus two thousand or a cleansweep seven id say i shall speak to professor dumbledore and see if we cant bend the firstyear rule heaven knows we need a better team than last year flattened in that last match by slytherin i couldnt look severus snape in the face for weeks professor mcgonagall peered sternly over her glasses at harry i want to hear youre training hard potter or i may change my mind about punishing you then she suddenly smiled your father would have been proud she said he was an excellent quidditch player himself youre joking it was dinnertime harry had just finished telling ron what had happened when hed left the grounds with professor mcgonagall ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth but hed forgotten all about it seeker he said but first years never you must be the youngest house player in about a century said harry shoveling pie into his mouth he felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon wood told me ron was so amazed so impressed he just sat and gaped at harry i start training next week said harry only dont tell anyone wood wants to keep it a secret fred and george weasley now came into the hall spotted harry and hurried over 152 the midnight duel well done said george in a low voice wood told us were on the team too beaters i tell you were going to win that quidditch cup for sure this year said fred we havent won since charlie left but this years team is going to be brilliant you must be good harry wood was almost skipping when he told us anyway weve got to go lee jordan reckons hes found a new secret passageway out of the school bet its that one behind the statue of gregory the smarmy that we found in our first week see you fred and george had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up malfoy flanked by crabbe and goyle having a last meal potter when are you getting the train back to the muggles youre a lot braver now that youre back on the ground and youve got your little friends with you said harry coolly there was of course nothing at all little about crabbe and goyle but as the high table was full of teachers neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl id take you on anytime on my own said malfoy tonight if you want wizards duel wands only no contact whats the matter never heard of a wizards duel before i suppose of course he has said ron wheeling around im his second whos yours malfoy looked at crabbe and goyle sizing them up crabbe he said midnight all right well meet you in the trophy room thats always unlocked when malfoy had gone ron and harry looked at each other 153 chapter nine what is a wizards duel said harry and what do you mean youre my second well a seconds there to take over if you die said ron casually getting started at last on his cold pie catching the look on harrys face he added quickly but people only die in proper duels you know with real wizards the most you and malfoyll be able to do is send sparks at each other neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage i bet he expected you to refuse anyway and what if i wave my wand and nothing happens throw it away and punch him on the nose ron suggested excuse me they both looked up it was hermione granger cant a person eat in peace in this place said ron hermione ignored him and spoke to harry i couldnt help overhearing what you and malfoy were saying bet you could ron muttered and you mustnt go wandering around the school at night think of the points youll lose gryffindor if youre caught and youre bound to be its really very selfish of you and its really none of your business said harry goodbye said ron all the same it wasnt what youd call the perfect end to the day harry thought as he lay awake much later listening to dean and seamus falling asleep neville wasnt back from the hospital wing ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as if he tries to curse you youd better dodge it because i cant remember how to 154 the midnight duel block them there was a very good chance they were going to get caught by filch or mrs norris and harry felt he was pushing his luck breaking another school rule today on the other hand malfoys sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness this was his big chance to beat malfoy facetoface he couldnt miss it halfpast eleven ron muttered at last wed better go they pulled on their bathrobes picked up their wands and crept across the tower room down the spiral staircase and into the gryffindor common room a few embers were still glowing in the fireplace turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows they had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them i cant believe youre going to do this harry a lamp flickered on it was hermione granger wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown you said ron furiously go back to bed i almost told your brother hermione snapped percy hes a prefect hed put a stop to this harry couldnt believe anyone could be so interfering come on he said to ron he pushed open the portrait of the fat lady and climbed through the hole hermione wasnt going to give up that easily she followed ron through the portrait hole hissing at them like an angry goose dont you care about gryffindor do you only care about yourselves i dont want slytherin to win the house cup and youll lose all the points i got from professor mcgonagall for knowing about switching spells go away 155 chapter nine all right but i warned you you just remember what i said when youre on the train home tomorrow youre so but what they were they didnt find out hermione had turned to the portrait of the fat lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting the fat lady had gone on a nighttime visit and hermione was locked out of gryffindor tower now what am i going to do she asked shrilly thats your problem said ron weve got to go were going to be late they hadnt even reached the end of the corridor when hermione caught up with them im coming with you she said you are not dyou think im going to stand out here and wait for filch to catch me if he finds all three of us ill tell him the truth that i was trying to stop you and you can back me up youve got some nerve said ron loudly shut up both of you said harry sharply i heard something it was a sort of snuffling mrs norris breathed ron squinting through the dark it wasnt mrs norris it was neville he was curled up on the floor fast asleep but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer thank goodness you found me ive been out here for hours i couldnt remember the new password to get in to bed keep your voice down neville the passwords pig snout but it wont help you now the fat ladys gone off somewhere hows your arm said harry fine said neville showing them madam pomfrey mended it in about a minute 156 the midnight duel good well look neville weve got to be somewhere well see you later dont leave me said neville scrambling to his feet i dont want to stay here alone the bloody barons been past twice already ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at hermione and neville if either of you get us caught ill never rest until ive learned that curse of the bogies quirrell told us about and used it on you hermione opened her mouth perhaps to tell ron exactly how to use the curse of the bogies but harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward they flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows at every turn harry expected to run into filch or mrs norris but they were lucky they sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room malfoy and crabbe werent there yet the crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them cups shields plates and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness they edged along the walls keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room harry took out his wand in case malfoy leapt in and started at once the minutes crept by hes late maybe hes chickened out ron whispered then a noise in the next room made them jump harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak and it wasnt malfoy sniff around my sweet they might be lurking in a corner it was filch speaking to mrs norris horrorstruck harry 157 chapter nine waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible they scurried silently toward the door away from filchs voice nevilles robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard filch enter the trophy room theyre in here somewhere they heard him mutter probably hiding this way harry mouthed to the others and petrified they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor they could hear filch getting nearer neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped grabbed ron around the waist and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor the clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle run harry yelled and the four of them sprinted down the gallery not looking back to see whether filch was following they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another harry in the lead without any idea where they were or where they were going they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway hurtled along it and came out near their charms classroom which they knew was miles from the trophy room i think weve lost him harry panted leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead neville was bent double wheezing and spluttering i told you hermione gasped clutching at the stitch in her chest i told you weve got to get back to gryffindor tower said ron quickly as possible 158 the midnight duel malfoy tricked you hermione said to harry you realize that dont you he was never going to meet you filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room malfoy must have tipped him off harry thought she was probably right but he wasnt going to tell her that lets go it wasnt going to be that simple they hadnt gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them it was peeves he caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight shut up peeves please youll get us thrown out peeves cackled wandering around at midnight ickle firsties tut tut tut naughty naughty youll get caughty not if you dont give us away peeves please should tell filch i should said peeves in a sanity voice but his eyes glittered wickedly its for your own good you know get out of the way snapped ron taking a swipe at peeves this was a big mistake students out of bed peeves bellowed students out of bed down the charms corridor ducking under peeves they ran for their lives right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door and it was locked this is it ron moaned as they pushed helplessly at the door were done for this is the end 159 chapter nine they could hear footsteps filch running as fast as he could toward peevess shouts oh move over hermione snarled she grabbed harrys wand tapped the lock and whispered alohomora the lock clicked and the door swung open they piled through it shut it quickly and pressed their ears against it listening which way did they go peeves filch was saying quick tell me say please dont mess with me peeves now where did they go shant say nothing if you dont say please said peeves in his annoying singsong voice all right please nothing ha haaa told you i wouldnt say nothing if you didnt say please ha ha haaaaaa and they heard the sound of peeves whooshing away and filch cursing in rage he thinks this door is locked harry whispered i think well be okay get off neville for neville had been tugging on the sleeve of harrys bathrobe for the last minute what harry turned around and saw quite clearly what for a moment he was sure hed walked into a nightmare this was too much on top of everything that had happened so far they werent in a room as he had supposed they were in a corridor the forbidden corridor on the third floor and now they knew why it was forbidden they were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor it had three heads three pairs of rolling mad eyes three noses twitching 160 the midnight duel and quivering in their direction three drooling mouths saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs it was standing quite still all six eyes staring at them and harry knew that the only reason they werent already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise but it was quickly getting over that there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant harry groped for the doorknob between filch and death hed take filch they fell backward harry slammed the door shut and they ran they almost flew back down the corridor filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else because they didnt see him anywhere but they hardly cared all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster they didnt stop running until they reached the portrait of the fat lady on the seventh floor where on earth have you all been she asked looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed sweaty faces never mind that pig snout pig snout panted harry and the portrait swung forward they scrambled into the common room and collapsed trembling into armchairs it was a while before any of them said anything neville indeed looked as if hed never speak again what do they think theyre doing keeping a thing like that locked up in a school said ron finally if any dog needs exercise that one does hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again 161 chapter nine you dont use your eyes any of you do you she snapped didnt you see what it was standing on the floor harry suggested i wasnt looking at its feet i was too busy with its heads no not the floor it was standing on a trapdoor its obviously guarding something she stood up glaring at them i hope youre pleased with yourselves we could all have been killed or worse expelled now if you dont mind im going to bed ron stared after her his mouth open no we dont mind he said youd think we dragged her along wouldnt you but hermione had given harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed the dog was guarding something what had hagrid said gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide except perhaps hogwarts it looked as though harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was 162 chapter ten halloween m alfoy couldnt believe his eyes when he saw that harry and ron were still at hogwarts the next day looking tired but perfectly cheerful indeed by the next morning harry and ron thought that meeting the threeheaded dog had been an excellent adventure and they were quite keen to have another one in the meantime harry filled ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from gringotts to hogwarts and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection its either really valuable or really dangerous said ron or both said harry but as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long they didnt have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues neither neville nor hermione showed the slightest interest in 163 chapter ten what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor all neville cared about was never going near the dog again hermione was now refusing to speak to harry and ron but she was such a bossy knowitall that they saw this as an added bonus all they really wanted now was a way of getting back at malfoy and to their great delight just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later as the owls flooded into the great hall as usual everyones attention was caught at once by a long thin package carried by six large screech owls harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him knocking his bacon to the floor they had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel harry ripped open the letter first which was lucky because it said do not open the parcel at the table it contains your new nimbus two thousand but i dont want everybody knowing youve got a broomstick or theyll all want one oliver wood will meet you tonight on the quidditch field at seven oclock for your first training session harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to ron to read 164 halloween a nimbus two thousand ron moaned enviously ive never even touched one they left the hall quickly wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by crabbe and goyle malfoy seized the package from harry and felt it thats a broomstick he said throwing it back to harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face youll be in for it this time potter first years arent allowed them ron couldnt resist it its not any old broomstick he said its a nimbus two thousand what did you say youve got at home malfoy a comet two sixty ron grinned at harry comets look flashy but theyre not in the same league as the nimbus what would you know about it weasley you couldnt afford half the handle malfoy snapped back i suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig before ron could answer professor flitwick appeared at malfoys elbow not arguing i hope boys he squeaked potters been sent a broomstick professor said malfoy quickly yes yes thats right said professor flitwick beaming at harry professor mcgonagall told me all about the special circumstances potter and what model is it a nimbus two thousand sir said harry fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on malfoys face and its really thanks to malfoy here that ive got it he added harry and ron headed upstairs smothering their laughter at malfoys obvious rage and confusion 165 chapter ten well its true harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase if he hadnt stolen nevilles remembrall i wouldnt be on the team so i suppose you think thats a reward for breaking rules came an angry voice from just behind them hermione was stomping up the stairs looking disapprovingly at the package in harrys hand i thought you werent speaking to us said harry yes dont stop now said ron its doing us so much good hermione marched away with her nose in the air harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day it kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed or straying off to the quidditch field where hed be learning to play that night he bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating and then rushed upstairs with ron to unwrap the nimbus two thousand at last wow ron sighed as the broomstick rolled onto harrys bedspread even harry who knew nothing about the different brooms thought it looked wonderful sleek and shiny with a mahogany handle it had a long tail of neat straight twigs and nimbus two thousand written in gold near the top as seven oclock drew nearer harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the quidditch field hed never been inside the stadium before hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on at either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end they reminded harry of the little plastic sticks muggle 166 halloween children blew bubbles through except that they were fifty feet high too eager to fly again to wait for wood harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground what a feeling he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field the nimbus two thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch hey potter come down oliver wood had arrived he was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm harry landed next to him very nice said wood his eyes glinting i see what mcgonagall meant you really are a natural im just going to teach you the rules this evening then youll be joining team practice three times a week he opened the crate inside were four differentsized balls right said wood now quidditch is easy enough to understand even if its not too easy to play there are seven players on each side three of them are called chasers three chasers harry repeated as wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball this balls called the quaffle said wood the chasers throw the quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal ten points every time the quaffle goes through one of the hoops follow me the chasers throw the quaffle and put it through the hoops to score harry recited so thats sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops isnt it whats basketball said wood curiously 167 chapter ten never mind said harry quickly now theres another player on each side whos called the keeper im keeper for gryffindor i have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring three chasers one keeper said harry who was determined to remember it all and they play with the quaffle okay got that so what are they for he pointed at the three balls left inside the box ill show you now said wood take this he handed harry a small club a bit like a short baseball bat im going to show you what the bludgers do wood said these two are the bludgers he showed harry two identical balls jet black and slightly smaller than the red quaffle harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box stand back wood warned harry he bent down and freed one of the bludgers at once the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at harrys face harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose and sent it zigzagging away into the air it zoomed around their heads and then shot at wood who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground see wood panted forcing the struggling bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely the bludgers rocket around trying to knock players off their brooms thats why you have two beaters on each team the weasley twins are ours its their job to protect their side from the bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team so think youve got all that 168 halloween three chasers try and score with the quaffle the keeper guards the goal posts the beaters keep the bludgers away from their team harry reeled off very good said wood er have the bludgers ever killed anyone harry asked hoping he sounded offhand never at hogwarts weve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that now the last member of the team is the seeker thats you and you dont have to worry about the quaffle or the bludgers unless they crack my head open dont worry the weasleys are more than a match for the bludgers i mean theyre like a pair of human bludgers themselves wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball compared with the quaffle and the bludgers it was tiny about the size of a large walnut it was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings this said wood is the golden snitch and its the most important ball of the lot its very hard to catch because its so fast and difficult to see its the seekers job to catch it youve got to weave in and out of the chasers beaters bludgers and quaffle to get it before the other teams seeker because whichever seeker catches the snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points so they nearly always win thats why seekers get fouled so much a game of quidditch only ends when the snitch is caught so it can go on for ages i think the record is three months they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep 169 chapter ten well thats it any questions harry shook his head he understood what he had to do all right it was doing it that was going to be the problem we wont practice with the snitch yet said wood carefully shutting it back inside the crate its too dark we might lose it lets try you out with a few of these he pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later he and harry were up in the air wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for harry to catch harry didnt miss a single one and wood was delighted after half an hour night had really fallen and they couldnt carry on that quidditch cupll have our name on it this year said wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle i wouldnt be surprised if you turn out better than charlie weasley and he could have played for england if he hadnt gone off chasing dragons perhaps it was because he was now so busy what with quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework but harry could hardly believe it when he realized that hed already been at hogwarts two months the castle felt more like home than privet drive ever had his lessons too were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics on halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors even better professor flitwick announced in charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly something they had all been dying to try since theyd seen him make nevilles toad zoom around the classroom professor flitwick put the class into pairs to practice harrys 170 halloween partner was seamus finnigan which was a relief because neville had been trying to catch his eye ron however was to be working with hermione granger it was hard to tell whether ron or hermione was angrier about this she hadnt spoken to either of them since the day harrys broomstick had arrived now dont forget that nice wrist movement weve been practicing squeaked professor flitwick perched on top of his pile of books as usual swish and flick remember swish and flick and saying the magic words properly is very important too never forget wizard baruffio who said s instead of f and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest it was very difficult harry and seamus swished and flicked but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it harry had to put it out with his hat ron at the next table wasnt having much more luck wingardium leviosa he shouted waving his long arms like a windmill youre saying it wrong harry heard hermione snap its winggardium leviosa make the gar nice and long you do it then if youre so clever ron snarled hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown flicked her wand and said wingardium leviosa their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads oh well done cried professor flitwick clapping everyone see here miss grangers done it ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class 171 chapter ten its no wonder no one can stand her he said to harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor shes a nightmare honestly someone knocked into harry as they hurried past him it was hermione harry caught a glimpse of her face and was startled to see that she was in tears i think she heard you so said ron but he looked a bit uncomfortable she mustve noticed shes got no friends hermione didnt turn up for the next class and wasnt seen all afternoon on their way down to the great hall for the halloween feast harry and ron overheard parvati patil telling her friend lavender that hermione was crying in the girls bathroom and wanted to be left alone ron looked still more awkward at this but a moment later they had entered the great hall where the halloween decorations put hermione out of their minds a thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds making the candles in the pumpkins stutter the feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates as it had at the startofterm banquet harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when professor quirrell came sprinting into the hall his turban askew and terror on his face everyone stared as he reached professor dumbledores chair slumped against the table and gasped troll in the dungeons thought you ought to know he then sank to the floor in a dead faint there was an uproar it took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of professor dumbledores wand to bring silence 172 halloween prefects he rumbled lead your houses back to the dormitories immediately percy was in his element follow me stick together first years no need to fear the troll if you follow my orders stay close behind me now make way first years coming through excuse me im a prefect how could a troll get in harry asked as they climbed the stairs dont ask me theyre supposed to be really stupid said ron maybe peeves let it in for a halloween joke they passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions as they jostled their way through a crowd of confused hufflepuffs harry suddenly grabbed rons arm ive just thought hermione what about her she doesnt know about the troll ron bit his lip oh all right he snapped but percyd better not see us ducking down they joined the hufflepuffs going the other way slipped down a deserted side corridor and hurried off toward the girls bathroom they had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them percy hissed ron pulling harry behind a large stone griffin peering around it however they saw not percy but snape he crossed the corridor and disappeared from view whats he doing harry whispered why isnt he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers search me 173 chapter ten quietly as possible they crept along the next corridor after snapes fading footsteps hes heading for the third floor harry said but ron held up his hand can you smell something harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean and then they heard it a low grunting and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet ron pointed at the end of a passage to the left something huge was moving toward them they shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight it was a horrible sight twelve feet tall its skin was a dull granite gray its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut it had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat horny feet the smell coming from it was incredible it was holding a huge wooden club which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long the troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside it waggled its long ears making up its tiny mind then slouched slowly into the room the keys in the lock harry muttered we could lock it in good idea said ron nervously they edged toward the open door mouths dry praying the troll wasnt about to come out of it with one great leap harry managed to grab the key slam the door and lock it yes flushed with their victory they started to run back up the pas 174 halloween sage but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop a high petrified scream and it was coming from the chamber theyd just chained up oh no said ron pale as the bloody baron its the girls bathroom harry gasped hermione they said together it was the last thing they wanted to do but what choice did they have wheeling around they sprinted back to the door and turned the key fumbling in their panic harry pulled the door open and they ran inside hermione granger was shrinking against the wall opposite looking as if she was about to faint the troll was advancing on her knocking the sinks off the walls as it went confuse it harry said desperately to ron and seizing a tap he threw it as hard as he could against the wall the troll stopped a few feet from hermione it lumbered around blinking stupidly to see what had made the noise its mean little eyes saw harry it hesitated then made for him instead lifting its club as it went oy peabrain yelled ron from the other side of the chamber and he threw a metal pipe at it the troll didnt even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder but it heard the yell and paused again turning its ugly snout toward ron instead giving harry time to run around it come on run run harry yelled at hermione trying to pull her toward the door but she couldnt move she was still flat against the wall her mouth open with terror the shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll 175 chapter ten berserk it roared again and started toward ron who was nearest and had no way to escape harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid he took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the trolls neck from behind the troll couldnt feel harry hanging there but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose and harrys wand had still been in his hand when hed jumped it had gone straight up one of the trolls nostrils howling with pain the troll twisted and flailed its club with harry clinging on for dear life any second the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club hermione had sunk to the floor in fright ron pulled out his own wand not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head wingardium leviosa the club flew suddenly out of the trolls hand rose high high up into the air turned slowly over and dropped with a sickening crack onto its owners head the troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face with a thud that made the whole room tremble harry got to his feet he was shaking and out of breath ron was standing there with his wand still raised staring at what he had done it was hermione who spoke first is it dead i dont think so said harry i think its just been knocked out he bent down and pulled his wand out of the trolls nose it was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue 176 halloween urgh troll boogers he wiped it on the trolls trousers a sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up they hadnt realized what a racket they had been making but of course someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the trolls roars a moment later professor mcgonagall had come bursting into the room closely followed by snape with quirrell bringing up the rear quirrell took one look at the troll let out a faint whimper and sat quickly down on a toilet clutching his heart snape bent over the troll professor mcgonagall was looking at ron and harry harry had never seen her look so angry her lips were white hopes of winning fifty points for gryffindor faded quickly from harrys mind what on earth were you thinking of said professor mcgonagall with cold fury in her voice harry looked at ron who was still standing with his wand in the air youre lucky you werent killed why arent you in your dormitory snape gave harry a swift piercing look harry looked at the floor he wished ron would put his wand down then a small voice came out of the shadows please professor mcgonagall they were looking for me miss granger hermione had managed to get to her feet at last i went looking for the troll because i i thought i could deal with it on my own you know because ive read all about them ron dropped his wand hermione granger telling a downright lie to a teacher 177 chapter ten if they hadnt found me id be dead now harry stuck his wand up its nose and ron knocked it out with its own club they didnt have time to come and fetch anyone it was about to finish me off when they arrived harry and ron tried to look as though this story wasnt new to them well in that case said professor mcgonagall staring at the three of them miss granger you foolish girl how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own hermione hung her head harry was speechless hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules and here she was pretending she had to get them out of trouble it was as if snape had started handing out sweets miss granger five points will be taken from gryffindor for this said professor mcgonagall im very disappointed in you if youre not hurt at all youd better get off to gryffindor tower students are finishing the feast in their houses hermione left professor mcgonagall turned to harry and ron well i still say you were lucky but not many first years could have taken on a fullgrown mountain troll you each win gryffindor five points professor dumbledore will be informed of this you may go they hurried out of the chamber and didnt speak at all until they had climbed two floors up it was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll quite apart from anything else we should have gotten more than ten points ron grumbled five you mean once shes taken off hermiones 178 halloween good of her to get us out of trouble like that ron admitted mind you we did save her she might not have needed saving if we hadnt locked the thing in with her harry reminded him they had reached the portrait of the fat lady pig snout they said and entered the common room was packed and noisy everyone was eating the food that had been sent up hermione however stood alone by the door waiting for them there was a very embarrassed pause then none of them looking at each other they all said thanks and hurried off to get plates but from that moment on hermione granger became their friend there are some things you cant share without ending up liking each other and knocking out a twelvefoot mountain troll is one of them 179 chapter eleven quidditch a s they entered november the weather turned very cold the mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel every morning the ground was covered in frost hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the quidditch field bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat rabbit fur gloves and enormous beaverskin boots the quidditch season had begun on saturday harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training gryffindor versus slytherin if gryffindor won they would move up into second place in the house championship hardly anyone had seen harry play because wood had decided that as their secret weapon harry should be kept well secret but the news that he was playing seeker had leaked out somehow and harry didnt know which was worse people telling him hed be 180 quidditch brilliant or people telling him theyd be running around underneath him holding a mattress it was really lucky that harry now had hermione as a friend he didnt know how hed have gotten through all his homework without her what with all the lastminute quidditch practice wood was making them do she had also lent him quidditch through the ages which turned out to be a very interesting read harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a world cup match in 1473 that seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players and that most serious quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them that although people rarely died playing quidditch referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the sahara desert hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since harry and ron had saved her from the mountain troll and she was much nicer for it the day before harrys first quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar they were standing with their backs to it getting warm when snape crossed the yard harry noticed at once that snape was limping harry ron and hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view they were sure it wouldnt be allowed unfortunately something about their guilty faces caught snapes eye he limped over he hadnt seen the fire but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway whats that youve got there potter it was quidditch through the ages harry showed him 181 chapter eleven library books are not to be taken outside the school said snape give it to me five points from gryffindor hes just made that rule up harry muttered angrily as snape limped away wonder whats wrong with his leg dunno but i hope its really hurting him said ron bitterly the gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening harry ron and hermione sat together next to a window hermione was checking harry and rons charms homework for them she would never let them copy how will you learn but by asking her to read it through they got the right answers anyway harry felt restless he wanted quidditch through the ages back to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow why should he be afraid of snape getting up he told ron and hermione he was going to ask snape if he could have it better you than me they said together but harry had an idea that snape wouldnt refuse if there were other teachers listening he made his way down to the staffroom and knocked there was no answer he knocked again nothing perhaps snape had left the book in there it was worth a try he pushed the door ajar and peered inside and a horrible scene met his eyes snape and filch were inside alone snape was holding his robes above his knees one of his legs was bloody and mangled filch was handing snape bandages blasted thing snape was saying how are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once harry tried to shut the door quietly but 182 quidditch potter snapes face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg harry gulped i just wondered if i could have my book back get out out harry left before snape could take any more points from gryffindor he sprinted back upstairs did you get it ron asked as harry joined them whats the matter in a low whisper harry told them what hed seen you know what this means he finished breathlessly he tried to get past that threeheaded dog at halloween thats where he was going when we saw him hes after whatever its guarding and id bet my broomstick he let that troll in to make a diversion hermiones eyes were wide no he wouldnt she said i know hes not very nice but he wouldnt try and steal something dumbledore was keeping safe honestly hermione you think all teachers are saints or something snapped ron im with harry i wouldnt put anything past snape but whats he after whats that dog guarding harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question neville was snoring loudly but harry couldnt sleep he tried to empty his mind he needed to sleep he had to he had his first quidditch match in a few hours but the expression on snapes face when harry had seen his leg wasnt easy to forget the next morning dawned very bright and cold the great hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer 183 chapter eleven ful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good quidditch match youve got to eat some breakfast i dont want anything just a bit of toast wheedled hermione im not hungry harry felt terrible in an hours time hed be walking onto the field harry you need your strength said seamus finnigan seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team thanks seamus said harry watching seamus pile ketchup on his sausages by eleven oclock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the quidditch pitch many students had binoculars the seats might be raised high in the air but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes ron and hermione joined neville seamus and dean the west ham fan up in the top row as a surprise for harry they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets scabbers had ruined it said potter for president and dean who was good at drawing had done a large gryffindor lion underneath then hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors meanwhile in the locker room harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet quidditch robes slytherin would be playing in green wood cleared his throat for silence 184 quidditch okay men he said and women said chaser angelina johnson and women wood agreed this is it the big one said fred weasley the one weve all been waiting for said george we know olivers speech by heart fred told harry we were on the team last year shut up you two said wood this is the best team gryffindors had in years were going to win i know it he glared at them all as if to say or else right its time good luck all of you harry followed fred and george out of the locker room and hoping his knees werent going to give way walked onto the field to loud cheers madam hooch was refereeing she stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams her broom in her hand now i want a nice fair game all of you she said once they were all gathered around her harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the slytherin captain marcus flint a fifth year harry thought flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above flashing potter for president over the crowd his heart skipped he felt braver mount your brooms please harry clambered onto his nimbus two thousand madam hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle fifteen brooms rose up high high into the air they were off and the quaffle is taken immediately by angelina johnson of 185 chapter eleven gryffindor what an excellent chaser that girl is and rather attractive too jordan sorry professor the weasley twins friend lee jordan was doing the commentary for the match closely watched by professor mcgonagall and shes really belting along up there a neat pass to alicia spinnet a good find of oliver woods last year only a reserve back to johnson and no the slytherins have taken the quaffle slytherin captain marcus flint gains the quaffle and off he goes flint flying like an eagle up there hes going to sc no stopped by an excellent move by gryffindor keeper wood and the gryffindors take the quaffle thats chaser katie bell of gryffindor there nice dive around flint off up the field and ouch that must have hurt hit in the back of the head by a bludger quaffle taken by the slytherins thats adrian pucey speeding off toward the goal posts but hes blocked by a second bludger sent his way by fred or george weasley cant tell which nice play by the gryffindor beater anyway and johnson back in possession of the quaffle a clear field ahead and off she goes shes really flying dodges a speeding bludger the goal posts are ahead come on now angelina keeper bletchley dives misses gryffindors score gryffindor cheers filled the cold air with howls and moans from the slytherins budge up there move along hagrid ron and hermione squeezed together to give hagrid enough space to join them 186 quidditch bin watchin from me hut said hagrid patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck but it isnt the same as bein in the crowd no sign of the snitch yet eh nope said ron harry hasnt had much to do yet kept outta trouble though thats somethin said hagrid raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was harry way up above them harry was gliding over the game squinting about for some sign of the snitch this was part of his and woods game plan keep out of the way until you catch sight of the snitch wood had said we dont want you attacked before you have to be when angelina had scored harry had done a couple of looptheloops to let off his feelings now he was back to staring around for the snitch once he caught sight of a flash of gold but it was just a reflection from one of the weasleys wristwatches and once a bludger decided to come pelting his way more like a cannonball than anything but harry dodged it and fred weasley came chasing after it all right there harry he had time to yell as he beat the bludger furiously toward marcus flint slytherin in possession lee jordan was saying chaser pucey ducks two bludgers two weasleys and chaser bell and speeds toward the wait a moment was that the snitch a murmur ran through the crowd as adrian pucey dropped the quaffle too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear harry saw it in a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold slytherin seeker terence higgs had seen it too neck and neck they hurtled toward the snitch all the 187 chapter eleven chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch harry was faster than higgs he could see the little round ball wings fluttering darting up ahead he put on an extra spurt of speed wham a roar of rage echoed from the gryffindors below marcus flint had blocked harry on purpose and harrys broom spun off course harry holding on for dear life foul screamed the gryffindors madam hooch spoke angrily to flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for gryffindor but in all the confusion of course the golden snitch had disappeared from sight again down in the stands dean thomas was yelling send him off ref red card what are you talking about dean said ron red card said dean furiously in soccer you get shown the red card and youre out of the game but this isnt soccer dean ron reminded him hagrid however was on deans side they oughta change the rules flint coulda knocked harry outta the air lee jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides so after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating jordan growled professor mcgonagall i mean after that open and revolting foul jordan im warning you all right all right flint nearly kills the gryffindor seeker which could happen to anyone im sure so a penalty to gryffindor 188 quidditch taken by spinnet who puts it away no trouble and we continue play gryffindor still in possession it was as harry dodged another bludger which went spinning dangerously past his head that it happened his broom gave a sudden frightening lurch for a split second he thought he was going to fall he gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees hed never felt anything like that it happened again it was as though the broom was trying to buck him off but nimbus two thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off harry tried to turn back toward the gryffindor goal posts he had half a mind to ask wood to call timeout and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control he couldnt turn it he couldnt direct it at all it was zigzagging through the air and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him lee was still commentating slytherin in possession flint with the quaffle passes spinnet passes bell hit hard in the face by a bludger hope it broke his nose only joking professor slytherins score oh no the slytherins were cheering no one seemed to have noticed that harrys broom was behaving strangely it was carrying him slowly higher away from the game jerking and twitching as it went dunno what harry thinks hes doing hagrid mumbled he stared through his binoculars if i didn know better id say hed lost control of his broom but he cant have suddenly people were pointing up at harry all over the stands 189 chapter eleven his broom had started to roll over and over with him only just managing to hold on then the whole crowd gasped harrys broom had given a wild jerk and harry swung off it he was now dangling from it holding on with only one hand did something happen to it when flint blocked him seamus whispered cant have hagrid said his voice shaking cant nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful dark magic no kid could do that to a nimbus two thousand at these words hermione seized hagrids binoculars but instead of looking up at harry she started looking frantically at the crowd what are you doing moaned ron grayfaced i knew it hermione gasped snape look ron grabbed the binoculars snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them he had his eyes fixed on harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath hes doing something jinxing the broom said hermione what should we do leave it to me before ron could say another word hermione had disappeared ron turned the binoculars back on harry his broom was vibrating so hard it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer the whole crowd was on its feet watching terrified as the weasleys flew up to try and pull harry safely onto one of their brooms but it was no good every time they got near him the broom would jump higher still they dropped lower and circled beneath him obviously hoping to catch him if he fell marcus 190 quidditch flint seized the quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing come on hermione ron muttered desperately hermione had fought her way across to the stand where snape stood and was now racing along the row behind him she didnt even stop to say sorry as she knocked professor quirrell headfirst into the row in front reaching snape she crouched down pulled out her wand and whispered a few wellchosen words bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of snapes robes it took perhaps thirty seconds for snape to realize that he was on fire a sudden yelp told her she had done her job scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket she scrambled back along the row snape would never know what had happened it was enough up in the air harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom neville you can look ron said neville had been sobbing into hagrids jacket for the last five minutes harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick he hit the field on all fours coughed and something gold fell into his hand ive got the snitch he shouted waving it above his head and the game ended in complete confusion he didnt catch it he nearly swallowed it flint was still howling twenty minutes later but it made no difference harry hadnt broken any rules and lee jordan was still happily shouting the results gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty harry heard none of this though he was being 191 chapter eleven made a cup of strong tea back in hagrids hut with ron and hermione it was snape ron was explaining hermione and i saw him he was cursing your broomstick muttering he wouldnt take his eyes off you rubbish said hagrid who hadnt heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands why would snape do somethin like that harry ron and hermione looked at one another wondering what to tell him harry decided on the truth i found out something about him he told hagrid he tried to get past that threeheaded dog on halloween it bit him we think he was trying to steal whatever its guarding hagrid dropped the teapot how do you know about fluffy he said fluffy yeah hes mine bought him off a greek chappie i met in the pub las year i lent him to dumbledore to guard the yes said harry eagerly now dont ask me anymore said hagrid gruffly thats top secret that is but snapes trying to steal it rubbish said hagrid again snapes a hogwarts teacher hed do nothin of the sort so why did he just try and kill harry cried hermione the afternoons events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about snape i know a jinx when i see one hagrid ive read all about them 192 quidditch youve got to keep eye contact and snape wasnt blinking at all i saw him im tellin yeh yer wrong said hagrid hotly i don know why harrys broom acted like that but snape wouldn try an kill a student now listen to me all three of yeh yer meddlin in things that don concern yeh its dangerous you forget that dog an you forget what its guardin thats between professor dumbledore an nicolas flamel aha said harry so theres someone called nicolas flamel involved is there hagrid looked furious with himself 193 chapter twelve the mirror of erised c hristmas was coming one morning in middecember hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow the lake froze solid and the weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed quirrell around bouncing off the back of his turban the few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by hagrid before they could fly off again no one could wait for the holidays to start while the gryffindor common room and the great hall had roaring fires the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms worst of all were professor snapes classes down in the dungeons where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons i do feel so sorry said draco malfoy one potions class for all 194 the mirror of erised those people who have to stay at hogwarts for christmas because theyre not wanted at home he was looking over at harry as he spoke crabbe and goyle chuckled harry who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish ignored them malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the quidditch match disgusted that the slytherins had lost he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a widemouthed tree frog would be replacing harry as seeker next then hed realized that nobody found this funny because they were all so impressed at the way harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick so malfoy jealous and angry had gone back to taunting harry about having no proper family it was true that harry wasnt going back to privet drive for christmas professor mcgonagall had come around the week before making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays and harry had signed up at once he didnt feel sorry for himself at all this would probably be the best christmas hed ever had ron and his brothers were staying too because mr and mrs weasley were going to romania to visit charlie when they left the dungeons at the end of potions they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that hagrid was behind it hi hagrid want any help ron asked sticking his head through the branches nah im all right thanks ron would you mind moving out of the way came malfoys cold drawl from behind them are you trying to earn some extra 195 chapter twelve money weasley hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave hogwarts i suppose that hut of hagrids must seem like a palace compared to what your familys used to ron dived at malfoy just as snape came up the stairs weasley ron let go of the front of malfoys robes he was provoked professor snape said hagrid sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree malfoy was insultin his family be that as it may fighting is against hogwarts rules hagrid said snape silkily five points from gryffindor weasley and be grateful it isnt more move along all of you malfoy crabbe and goyle pushed roughly past the tree scattering needles everywhere and smirking ill get him said ron grinding his teeth at malfoys back one of these days ill get him i hate them both said harry malfoy and snape come on cheer up its nearly christmas said hagrid tell yeh what come with me an see the great hall looks a treat so the three of them followed hagrid and his tree off to the great hall where professor mcgonagall and professor flitwick were busy with the christmas decorations ah hagrid the last tree put it in the far corner would you the hall looked spectacular festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls and no less than twelve towering christmas trees stood around the room some sparkling with tiny icicles some glittering with hundreds of candles how many days you got left until yer holidays hagrid asked 196 the mirror of erised just one said hermione and that reminds me harry ron weve got half an hour before lunch we should be in the library oh yeah youre right said ron tearing his eyes away from professor flitwick who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree the library said hagrid following them out of the hall just before the holidays bit keen arent yeh oh were not working harry told him brightly ever since you mentioned nicolas flamel weve been trying to find out who he is you what hagrid looked shocked listen here ive told yeh drop it its nothin to you what that dogs guardin we just want to know who nicolas flamel is thats all said hermione unless youd like to tell us and save us the trouble harry added we mustve been through hundreds of books already and we cant find him anywhere just give us a hint i know ive read his name somewhere im sayin nothin said hagrid flatly just have to find out for ourselves then said ron and they left hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library they had indeed been searching books for flamels name ever since hagrid had let it slip because how else were they going to find out what snape was trying to steal the trouble was it was very hard to know where to begin not knowing what flamel might have done to get himself into a book he wasnt in great wizards of the twentieth century or notable magical names of our time he 197 chapter twelve was missing too from important modern magical discoveries and a study of recent developments in wizardry and then of course there was the sheer size of the library tens of thousands of books thousands of shelves hundreds of narrow rows hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random harry wandered over to the restricted section he had been wondering for a while if flamel wasnt somewhere in there unfortunately you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books and he knew hed never get one these were the books containing powerful dark magic never taught at hogwarts and only read by older students studying advanced defense against the dark arts what are you looking for boy nothing said harry madam pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him youd better get out then go on out wishing hed been a bit quicker at thinking up some story harry left the library he ron and hermione had already agreed theyd better not ask madam pince where they could find flamel they were sure shed be able to tell them but they couldnt risk snape hearing what they were up to harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything but he wasnt very hopeful they had been looking for two weeks after all but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasnt surprising theyd found nothing what they really needed was a nice long search without madam pince breathing down their necks 198 the mirror of erised five minutes later ron and hermione joined him shaking their heads they went off to lunch you will keep looking while im away wont you said hermione and send me an owl if you find anything and you could ask your parents if they know who flamel is said ron itd be safe to ask them very safe as theyre both dentists said hermione once the holidays had started ron and harry were having too good a time to think much about flamel they had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire they sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork bread english muffins marshmallows and plotting ways of getting malfoy expelled which were fun to talk about even if they wouldnt work ron also started teaching harry wizard chess this was exactly like muggle chess except that the figures were alive which made it a lot like directing troops in battle rons set was very old and battered like everything else he owned it had once belonged to someone else in his family in this case his grandfather however old chessmen werent a drawback at all ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted harry played with chessmen seamus finnigan had lent him and they didnt trust him at all he wasnt a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him which was confusing dont send me there cant you see his knight send him we can afford to lose him 199 chapter twelve on christmas eve harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun but not expecting any presents at all when he woke early in the morning however the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed merry christmas said ron sleepily as harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe you too said harry will you look at this ive got some presents what did you expect turnips said ron turning to his own pile which was a lot bigger than harrys harry picked up the top parcel it was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was to harry from hagrid inside was a roughly cut wooden flute hagrid had obviously whittled it himself harry blew it it sounded a bit like an owl a second very small parcel contained a note we received your message and enclose your christmas present from uncle vernon and aunt petunia taped to the note was a fiftypence piece thats friendly said harry ron was fascinated by the fifty pence weird he said what a shape this is money you can keep it said harry laughing at how pleased ron was hagrid and my aunt and uncle so who sent these i think i know who that ones from said ron turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel my mom i told her you didnt expect any presents and oh no he groaned shes made you a weasley sweater harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick handknitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge 200 the mirror of erised every year she makes us a sweater said ron unwrapping his own and mines always maroon thats really nice of her said harry trying the fudge which was very tasty his next present also contained candy a large box of chocolate frogs from hermione this only left one parcel harry picked it up and felt it it was very light he unwrapped it something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds ron gasped ive heard of those he said in a hushed voice dropping the box of every flavor beans hed gotten from hermione if thats what i think it is theyre really rare and really valuable what is it harry picked the shining silvery cloth off the floor it was strange to the touch like water woven into material its an invisibility cloak said ron a look of awe on his face im sure it is try it on harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and ron gave a yell it is look down harry looked down at his feet but they were gone he dashed to the mirror sure enough his reflection looked back at him just his head suspended in midair his body completely invisible he pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely theres a note said ron suddenly a note fell out of it harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter written in narrow loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words 201 chapter twelve your father left this in my possession before he died it is time it was returned to you use it well a very merry christmas to you there was no signature harry stared at the note ron was admiring the cloak id give anything for one of these he said anything whats the matter nothing said harry he felt very strange who had sent the cloak had it really once belonged to his father before he could say or think anything else the dormitory door was flung open and fred and george weasley bounded in harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight he didnt feel like sharing it with anyone else yet merry christmas hey look harrys got a weasley sweater too fred and george were wearing blue sweaters one with a large yellow f on it the other a g harrys is better than ours though said fred holding up harrys sweater she obviously makes more of an effort if youre not family why arent you wearing yours ron george demanded come on get it on theyre lovely and warm i hate maroon ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head you havent got a letter on yours george observed i suppose she thinks you dont forget your name but were not stupid we know were called gred and forge 202 the mirror of erised whats all this noise percy weasley stuck his head through the door looking disapproving he had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he too carried a lumpy sweater over his arm which fred seized p for prefect get it on percy come on were all wearing ours even harry got one i dont want said percy thickly as the twins forced the sweater over his head knocking his glasses askew and youre not sitting with the prefects today either said george christmas is a time for family they frogmarched percy from the room his arms pinned to his side by his sweater harry had never in all his life had such a christmas dinner a hundred fat roast turkeys mountains of roast and boiled potatoes platters of chipolatas tureens of buttered peas silver boats of thick rich gravy and cranberry sauce and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table these fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble muggle ones the dursleys usually bought with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside harry pulled a wizard cracker with fred and it didnt just bang it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke while from the inside exploded a rear admirals hat and several live white mice up at the high table dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizards hat for a flowered bonnet and was chuckling merrily at a joke professor flitwick had just read him flaming christmas puddings followed the turkey percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice harry 203 chapter twelve watched hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine finally kissing professor mcgonagall on the cheek who to harrys amazement giggled and blushed her top hat lopsided when harry finally left the table he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers including a pack of nonexplodable luminous balloons a growyourownwarts kit and his own new wizard chess set the white mice had disappeared and harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as mrs norriss christmas dinner harry and the weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds then cold wet and gasping for breath they returned to the fire in the gryffindor common room where harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to ron he suspected he wouldnt have lost so badly if percy hadnt tried to help him so much after a meal of turkey sandwiches crumpets trifle and christmas cake everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch percy chase fred and george all over gryffindor tower because theyd stolen his prefect badge it had been harrys best christmas day ever yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it ron full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him fell asleep almost as soon as hed drawn the curtains of his fourposter harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it 204 the mirror of erised his fathers this had been his fathers he let the material flow over his hands smoother than silk light as air use it well the note had said he had to try it now he slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself looking down at his legs he saw only moonlight and shadows it was a very funny feeling use it well suddenly harry felt wideawake the whole of hogwarts was open to him in this cloak excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence he could go anywhere in this anywhere and filch would never know ron grunted in his sleep should harry wake him something held him back his fathers cloak he felt that this time the first time he wanted to use it alone he crept out of the dormitory down the stairs across the common room and climbed through the portrait hole whos there squawked the fat lady harry said nothing he walked quickly down the corridor where should he go he stopped his heart racing and thought and then it came to him the restricted section in the library hed be able to read as long as he liked as long as it took to find out who flamel was he set off drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked the library was pitchblack and very eerie harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books the lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair and even though harry could feel his arm supporting it the sight gave him the creeps the restricted section was right at the back of the library step 205 chapter twelve ping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library he held up his lamp to read the titles they didnt tell him much their peeling faded gold letters spelled words in languages harry couldnt understand some had no title at all one book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood the hairs on the back of harrys neck prickled maybe he was imagining it maybe not but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books as though they knew someone was there who shouldnt be he had to start somewhere setting the lamp down carefully on the floor he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book a large black and silver volume caught his eye he pulled it out with difficulty because it was very heavy and balancing it on his knee let it fall open a piercing bloodcurdling shriek split the silence the book was screaming harry snapped it shut but the shriek went on and on one high unbroken earsplitting note he stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp which went out at once panicking he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf he ran for it he passed filch in the doorway filchs pale wild eyes looked straight through him and harry slipped under filchs outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor the books shrieks still ringing in his ears he came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor he had been so busy getting away from the library he hadnt paid attention to where he was going perhaps because it was dark he didnt recognize where he was at all there was a suit of armor near the kitchens he knew but he must be five floors above there 206 the mirror of erised you asked me to come directly to you professor if anyone was wandering around at night and somebodys been in the library restricted section harry felt the blood drain out of his face wherever he was filch must know a shortcut because his soft greasy voice was getting nearer and to his horror it was snape who replied the restricted section well they cant be far well catch them harry stood rooted to the spot as filch and snape came around the corner ahead they couldnt see him of course but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer theyd knock right into him the cloak didnt stop him from being solid he backed away as quietly as he could a door stood ajar to his left it was his only hope he squeezed through it holding his breath trying not to move it and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything they walked straight past and harry leaned against the wall breathing deeply listening to their footsteps dying away that had been close very close it was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in it looked like an unused classroom the dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls and there was an upturned wastepaper basket but propped against the wall facing him was something that didnt look as if it belonged there something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way it was a magnificent mirror as high as the ceiling with an ornate gold frame standing on two clawed feet there was an inscription carved around the top erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi 207 chapter twelve his panic fading now that there was no sound of filch and snape harry moved nearer to the mirror wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again he stepped in front of it he had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming he whirled around his heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed for he had seen not only himself in the mirror but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him but the room was empty breathing very fast he turned slowly back to the mirror there he was reflected in it white and scaredlooking and there reflected behind him were at least ten others harry looked over his shoulder but still no one was there or were they all invisible too was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirrors trick was that it reflected them invisible or not he looked in the mirror again a woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving he reached out a hand and felt the air behind him if she was really there hed touch her their reflections were so close together but he felt only air she and the others existed only in the mirror she was a very pretty woman she had dark red hair and her eyes her eyes are just like mine harry thought edging a little closer to the glass bright green exactly the same shape but then he noticed that she was crying smiling but crying at the same time the tall thin blackhaired man standing next to her put his arm around her he wore glasses and his hair was very untidy it stuck up at the back just as harrys did harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection 208 the mirror of erised mom he whispered dad they just looked at him smiling and slowly harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror and saw other pairs of green eyes like his other noses like his even a little old man who looked as though he had harrys knobbly knees harry was looking at his family for the first time in his life the potters smiled and waved at harry and he stared hungrily back at them his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them he had a powerful kind of ache inside him half joy half terrible sadness how long he stood there he didnt know the reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses he couldnt stay here he had to find his way back to bed he tore his eyes away from his mothers face whispered ill come back and hurried from the room you could have woken me up said ron crossly you can come tonight im going back i want to show you the mirror id like to see your mom and dad ron said eagerly and i want to see all your family all the weasleys youll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone you can see them any old time said ron just come round my house this summer anyway maybe it only shows dead people shame about not finding flamel though have some bacon or something why arent you eating anything harry couldnt eat he had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight he had almost forgotten about flamel it didnt seem very important anymore who cared what the three 209 chapter twelve headed dog was guarding what did it matter if snape stole it really are you all right said ron you look odd what harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again with ron covered in the cloak too they had to walk much more slowly the next night they tried retracing harrys route from the library wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour im freezing said ron lets forget it and go back no harry hissed i know its here somewhere they passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction but saw no one else just as ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold harry spotted the suit of armor its here just here yes they pushed the door open harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror there they were his mother and father beamed at the sight of him see harry whispered i cant see anything look look at them all there are loads of them i can only see you look in it properly go on stand where i am harry stepped aside but with ron in front of the mirror he couldnt see his family anymore just ron in his paisley pajamas ron though was staring transfixed at his image look at me he said can you see all your family standing around you 210 the mirror of erised no im alone but im different i look older and im head boy what i am im wearing the badge like bill used to and im holding the house cup and the quidditch cup im quidditch captain too ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at harry do you think this mirror shows the future how can it all my family are dead let me have another look you had it to yourself all last night give me a bit more time youre only holding the quidditch cup whats interesting about that i want to see my parents dont push me a sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion they hadnt realized how loudly they had been talking quick ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of mrs norris came round the door ron and harry stood quite still both thinking the same thing did the cloak work on cats after what seemed an age she turned and left this isnt safe she might have gone for filch i bet she heard us come on and ron pulled harry out of the room the snow still hadnt melted the next morning want to play chess harry said ron no 211 chapter twelve why dont we go down and visit hagrid no you go i know what youre thinking about harry that mirror dont go back tonight why not i dunno ive just got a bad feeling about it and anyway youve had too many close shaves already filch snape and mrs norris are wandering around so what if they cant see you what if they walk into you what if you knock something over you sound like hermione im serious harry dont go but harry only had one thought in his head which was to get back in front of the mirror and ron wasnt going to stop him that third night he found his way more quickly than before he was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise but he didnt meet anyone and there were his mother and father smiling at him again and one of his grandfathers nodding happily harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror there was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family nothing at all except so back again harry harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice he looked behind him sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than albus dumbledore harry must have walked straight past him so desperate to get to the mirror he hadnt noticed him i i didnt see you sir 212 the mirror of erised strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you said dumbledore and harry was relieved to see that he was smiling so said dumbledore slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with harry you like hundreds before you have discovered the delights of the mirror of erised i didnt know it was called that sir but i expect youve realized by now what it does it well it shows me my family and it showed your friend ron himself as head boy how did you know i dont need a cloak to become invisible said dumbledore gently now can you think what the mirror of erised shows us all harry shook his head let me explain the happiest man on earth would be able to use the mirror of erised like a normal mirror that is he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is does that help harry thought then he said slowly it shows us what we want whatever we want yes and no said dumbledore quietly it shows us nothing more or less than the deepest most desperate desire of our hearts you who have never known your family see them standing around you ronald weasley who has always been overshadowed by his brothers sees himself standing alone the best of all of them however this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth men have wasted away before it entranced by what they have seen or been driven mad not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible the mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow harry 213 chapter twelve and i ask you not to go looking for it again if you ever do run across it you will now be prepared it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live remember that now why dont you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed harry stood up sir professor dumbledore can i ask you something obviously youve just done so dumbledore smiled you may ask me one more thing however what do you see when you look in the mirror i i see myself holding a pair of thick woolen socks harry stared one can never have enough socks said dumbledore another christmas has come and gone and i didnt get a single pair people will insist on giving me books it was only when he was back in bed that it struck harry that dumbledore might not have been quite truthful but then he thought as he shoved scabbers off his pillow it had been quite a personal question 214 chapter thirteen nicholas flamel d umbledore had convinced harry not to go looking for the mirror of erised again and for the rest of the christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk harry wished he could forget what hed seen in the mirror as easily but he couldnt he started having nightmares over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light while a high voice cackled with laughter you see dumbledore was right that mirror could drive you mad said ron when harry told him about these dreams hermione who came back the day before term started took a different view of things she was torn between horror at the idea of harry being out of bed roaming the school three nights in a row if filch had caught you and disappointment that he hadnt at least found out who nicolas flamel was they had almost given up hope of ever finding flamel in a li 215 chapter thirteen brary book even though harry was still sure hed read the name somewhere once term had started they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks harry had even less time than the other two because quidditch practice had started again wood was working the team harder than ever even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldnt dampen his spirits the weasleys complained that wood was becoming a fanatic but harry was on woods side if they won their next match against hufflepuff they would overtake slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years quite apart from wanting to win harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training then during one particularly wet and muddy practice session wood gave the team a bit of bad news hed just gotten very angry with the weasleys who kept divebombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms will you stop messing around he yelled thats exactly the sort of thing thatll lose us the match snapes refereeing this time and hell be looking for any excuse to knock points off gryffindor george weasley really did fall off his broom at these words snapes refereeing he spluttered through a mouthful of mud whens he ever refereed a quidditch match hes not going to be fair if we might overtake slytherin the rest of the team landed next to george to complain too its not my fault said wood weve just got to make sure we play a clean game so snape hasnt got an excuse to pick on us 216 nicholas flamel which was all very well thought harry but he had another reason for not wanting snape near him while he was playing quidditch the rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice but harry headed straight back to the gryffindor common room where he found ron and hermione playing chess chess was the only thing hermione ever lost at something harry and ron thought was very good for her dont talk to me for a moment said ron when harry sat down next to him i need to concen he caught sight of harrys face whats the matter with you you look terrible speaking quietly so that no one else would hear harry told the other two about snapes sudden sinister desire to be a quidditch referee dont play said hermione at once say youre ill said ron pretend to break your leg hermione suggested really break your leg said ron i cant said harry there isnt a reserve seeker if i back out gryffindor cant play at all at that moment neville toppled into the common room how he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyones guess because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the leglocker curse he must have had to bunny hop all the way up to gryffindor tower everyone fell over laughing except hermione who leapt up and performed the countercurse nevilles legs sprang apart and he got to his feet trembling 217 chapter thirteen what happened hermione asked him leading him over to sit with harry and ron malfoy said neville shakily i met him outside the library he said hed been looking for someone to practice that on go to professor mcgonagall hermione urged neville report him neville shook his head i dont want more trouble he mumbled youve got to stand up to him neville said ron hes used to walking all over people but thats no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier theres no need to tell me im not brave enough to be in gryffindor malfoys already done that neville choked out harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a chocolate frog the very last one from the box hermione had given him for christmas he gave it to neville who looked as though he might cry youre worth twelve of malfoy harry said the sorting hat chose you for gryffindor didnt it and wheres malfoy in stinking slytherin nevilles lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog thanks harry i think ill go to bed dyou want the card you collect them dont you as neville walked away harry looked at the famous wizard card dumbledore again he said he was the first one i ever he gasped he stared at the back of the card then he looked up at ron and hermione 218 nicholas flamel ive found him he whispered ive found flamel i told you id read the name somewhere before i read it on the train coming here listen to this dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in 1945 for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamel hermione jumped to her feet she hadnt looked so excited since theyd gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework stay there she said and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls dormitories harry and ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back an enormous old book in her arms i never thought to look in here she whispered excitedly i got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading light said ron but hermione told him to be quiet until shed looked something up and started flicking frantically through the pages muttering to herself at last she found what she was looking for i knew it i knew it are we allowed to speak yet said ron grumpily hermione ignored him nicolas flamel she whispered dramatically is the only known maker of the sorcerers stone this didnt have quite the effect shed expected the what said harry and ron oh honestly dont you two read look read that there she pushed the book toward them and harry and ron read 219 chapter thirteen the ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the sorcerers stone a legendary substance with astonishing powers the stone will transform any metal into pure gold it also produces the elixir of life which will make the drinker immortal there have been many reports of the sorcerers stone over the centuries but the only stone currently in existence belongs to mr nicolas flamel the noted alchemist and opera lover mr flamel who celebrated his six hundred and sixtyfifth birthday last year enjoys a quiet life in devon with his wife perenelle six hundred and fiftyeight see said hermione when harry and ron had finished the dog must be guarding flamels sorcerers stone i bet he asked dumbledore to keep it safe for him because theyre friends and he knew someone was after it thats why he wanted the stone moved out of gringotts a stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying said harry no wonder snapes after it anyone would want it and no wonder we couldnt find flamel in that study of recent developments in wizardry said ron hes not exactly recent if hes six hundred and sixtyfive is he the next morning in defense against the dark arts while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites harry and ron were still discussing what theyd do with a sorcerers stone if they had one it wasnt until ron said hed buy his own quidditch team that harry remembered about snape and the coming match 220 nicholas flamel im going to play he told ron and hermione if i dont all the slytherins will think im just too scared to face snape ill show them itll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win just as long as were not wiping you off the field said hermione as the match drew nearer however harry became more and more nervous whatever he told ron and hermione the rest of the team wasnt too calm either the idea of overtaking slytherin in the house championship was wonderful no one had done it for seven years but would they be allowed to with such a biased referee harry didnt know whether he was imagining it or not but he seemed to keep running into snape wherever he went at times he even wondered whether snape was following him trying to catch him on his own potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture snape was so horrible to harry could snape possibly know theyd found out about the sorcerers stone harry didnt see how he could yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that snape could read minds harry knew when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon that ron and hermione were wondering whether theyd ever see him alive again this wasnt what youd call comforting harry hardly heard a word of woods pep talk as he pulled on his quidditch robes and picked up his nimbus two thousand ron and hermione meanwhile had found a place in the stands next to neville who couldnt understand why they looked so grim and worried or why they had both brought their wands to the 221 chapter thirteen match little did harry know that ron and hermione had been secretly practicing the leglocker curse theyd gotten the idea from malfoy using it on neville and were ready to use it on snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt harry now dont forget its locomotor mortis hermione muttered as ron slipped his wand up his sleeve i know ron snapped dont nag back in the locker room wood had taken harry aside dont want to pressure you potter but if we ever need an early capture of the snitch its now finish the game before snape can favor hufflepuff too much the whole schools out there said fred weasley peering out of the door even blimey dumbledores come to watch harrys heart did a somersault dumbledore he said dashing to the door to make sure fred was right there was no mistaking that silver beard harry could have laughed out loud with relief he was safe there was simply no way that snape would dare to try to hurt him if dumbledore was watching perhaps that was why snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field something that ron noticed too ive never seen snape look so mean he told hermione look theyre off ouch someone had poked ron in the back of the head it was malfoy oh sorry weasley didnt see you there malfoy grinned broadly at crabbe and goyle wonder how long potters going to stay on his broom this time anyone want a bet what about you weasley 222 nicholas flamel ron didnt answer snape had just awarded hufflepuff a penalty because george weasley had hit a bludger at him hermione who had all her fingers crossed in her lap was squinting fixedly at harry who was circling the game like a hawk looking for the snitch you know how i think they choose people for the gryffindor team said malfoy loudly a few minutes later as snape awarded hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all its people they feel sorry for see theres potter whos got no parents then theres the weasleys whove got no money you should be on the team longbottom youve got no brains neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face malfoy im worth twelve of you malfoy he stammered malfoy crabbe and goyle howled with laughter but ron still not daring to take his eyes from the game said you tell him neville longbottom if brains were gold youd be poorer than weasley and thats saying something rons nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about harry im warning you malfoy one more word ron said hermione suddenly harry what where harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd hermione stood up her crossed fingers in her mouth as harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet youre in luck weasley potters obviously spotted some money on the ground said malfoy 223 chapter thirteen ron snapped before malfoy knew what was happening ron was on top of him wrestling him to the ground neville hesitated then clambered over the back of his seat to help come on harry hermione screamed leaping onto her seat to watch as harry sped straight at snape she didnt even notice malfoy and ron rolling around under her seat or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was neville crabbe and goyle up in the air snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him missing him by inches the next second harry had pulled out of the dive his arm raised in triumph the snitch clasped in his hand the stands erupted it had to be a record no one could ever remember the snitch being caught so quickly ron ron where are you the games over harrys won weve won gryffindor is in the lead shrieked hermione dancing up and down on her seat and hugging parvati patil in the row in front harry jumped off his broom a foot from the ground he couldnt believe it hed done it the game was over it had barely lasted five minutes as gryffindors came spilling onto the field he saw snape land nearby whitefaced and tightlipped then harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into dumbledores smiling face well done said dumbledore quietly so that only harry could hear nice to see you havent been brooding about that mirror been keeping busy excellent snape spat bitterly on the ground 224 nicholas flamel harry left the locker room alone some time later to take his nimbus two thousand back to the broomshed he couldnt ever remember feeling happier hed really done something to be proud of now no one could say he was just a famous name any more the evening air had never smelled so sweet he walked over the damp grass reliving the last hour in his head which was a happy blur gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders ron and hermione in the distance jumping up and down ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed harry had reached the shed he leaned against the wooden door and looked up at hogwarts with its windows glowing red in the setting sun gryffindor in the lead hed done it hed shown snape and speaking of snape a hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle clearly not wanting to be seen it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest harrys victory faded from his mind as he watched he recognized the figures prowling walk snape sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner what was going on harry jumped back on his nimbus two thousand and took off gliding silently over the castle he saw snape enter the forest at a run he followed the trees were so thick he couldnt see where snape had gone he flew in circles lower and lower brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices he glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree he climbed carefully along one of the branches holding tight to his broomstick trying to see through the leaves 225 chapter thirteen below in a shadowy clearing stood snape but he wasnt alone quirrell was there too harry couldnt make out the look on his face but he was stuttering worse than ever harry strained to catch what they were saying ddont know why you wanted ttto meet here of all pplaces severus oh i thought wed keep this private said snape his voice icy students arent supposed to know about the sorcerers stone after all harry leaned forward quirrell was mumbling something snape interrupted him have you found out how to get past that beast of hagrids yet bbbut severus i you dont want me as your enemy quirrell said snape taking a step toward him ii dont know what you you know perfectly well what i mean an owl hooted loudly and harry nearly fell out of the tree he steadied himself in time to hear snape say your little bit of hocuspocus im waiting bbut i dddont very well snape cut in well have another little chat soon when youve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie he threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing it was almost dark now but harry could see quirrell standing quite still as though he was petrified 226 nicholas flamel harry where have you been hermione squeaked we won you won we won shouted ron thumping harry on the back and i gave malfoy a black eye and neville tried to take on crabbe and goyle singlehanded hes still out cold but madam pomfrey says hell be all right talk about showing slytherin everyones waiting for you in the common room were having a party fred and george stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens never mind that now said harry breathlessly lets find an empty room you wait til you hear this he made sure peeves wasnt inside before shutting the door behind them then he told them what hed seen and heard so we were right it is the sorcerers stone and snapes trying to force quirrell to help him get it he asked if he knew how to get past fluffy and he said something about quirrells hocuspocus i reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from fluffy loads of enchantments probably and quirrell would have done some antidark arts spell that snape needs to break through so you mean the stones only safe as long as quirrell stands up to snape said hermione in alarm itll be gone by next tuesday said ron 227 chapter fourteen norbert the norwegian ridgeback q uirrell however must have been braver than theyd thought in the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner but it didnt look as though hed cracked yet every time they passed the thirdfloor corridor harry ron and hermione would press their ears to the door to check that fluffy was still growling inside snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper which surely meant that the stone was still safe whenever harry passed quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile and ron had started telling people off for laughing at quirrells stutter hermione however had more on her mind than the sorcerers stone she had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes harry and ron wouldnt have minded but she kept nagging them to do the same hermione the exams are ages away 228 norbert the norwegian ridgeback ten weeks hermione snapped thats not ages thats like a second to nicolas flamel but were not six hundred years old ron reminded her anyway what are you studying for you already know it all what am i studying for are you crazy you realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year theyre very important i should have started studying a month ago i dont know whats gotten into me unfortunately the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as hermione they piled so much homework on them that the easter holidays werent nearly as much fun as the christmas ones it was hard to relax with hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragons blood or practicing wand movements moaning and yawning harry and ron spent most of their free time in the library with her trying to get through all their extra work ill never remember this ron burst out one afternoon throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window it was the first really fine day theyd had in months the sky was a clear forgetmenot blue and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming harry who was looking up dittany in one thousand magical herbs and fungi didnt look up until he heard ron say hagrid what are you doing in the library hagrid shuffled into view hiding something behind his back he looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat jus lookin he said in a shifty voice that got their interest at once an whatre you lot up ter he looked suddenly suspicious yer not still lookin fer nicolas flamel are yeh 229 chapter fourteen oh we found out who he is ages ago said ron impressively and we know what that dogs guarding its a sorcerers st shhhh hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening don go shoutin about it whats the matter with yeh there are a few things we wanted to ask you as a matter of fact said harry about whats guarding the stone apart from fluffy shhhh said hagrid again listen come an see me later im not promisin ill tell yeh anythin mind but don go rabbitin about it in here students aren spposed ter know theyll think ive told yeh see you later then said harry hagrid shuffled off what was he hiding behind his back said hermione thoughtfully do you think it had anything to do with the stone im going to see what section he was in said ron whod had enough of working he came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table dragons he whispered hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons look at these dragon species of great britain and ireland from egg to inferno a dragon keepers guide hagrids always wanted a dragon he told me so the first time i ever met him said harry but its against our laws said ron dragon breeding was outlawed by the warlocks convention of 1709 everyone knows that its hard to stop muggles from noticing us if were keeping dragons in the back garden anyway you cant tame dragons its dan 230 norbert the norwegian ridgeback gerous you should see the burns charlies got off wild ones in romania but there arent wild dragons in britain said harry of course there are said ron common welsh green and hebridean blacks the ministry of magic has a job hushing them up i can tell you our kind have to keep putting spells on muggles whove spotted them to make them forget so what on earths hagrid up to said hermione when they knocked on the door of the gamekeepers hut an hour later they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed hagrid called who is it before he let them in and then shut the door quickly behind them it was stifling hot inside even though it was such a warm day there was a blazing fire in the grate hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches which they refused so yeh wanted to ask me somethin yes said harry there was no point beating around the bush we were wondering if you could tell us whats guarding the sorcerers stone apart from fluffy hagrid frowned at him o course i cant he said number one i don know meself number two yeh know too much already so i wouldn tell yeh if i could that stones here fer a good reason it was almost stolen outta gringotts i sppose yehve worked that out an all beats me how yeh even know abou fluffy oh come on hagrid you might not want to tell us but you do know you know everything that goes on round here said 231 chapter fourteen hermione in a warm flattering voice hagrids beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling we only wondered who had done the guarding really hermione went on we wondered who dumbledore had trusted enough to help him apart from you hagrids chest swelled at these last words harry and ron beamed at hermione well i don spose it could hurt ter tell yeh that lets see he borrowed fluffy from me then some o the teachers did enchantments professor sprout professor flitwick professor mcgonagall he ticked them off on his fingers professor quirrell an dumbledore himself did somethin o course hang on ive forgotten someone oh yeah professor snape snape yeah yer not still on abou that are yeh look snape helped protect the stone hes not about ter steal it harry knew ron and hermione were thinking the same as he was if snape had been in on protecting the stone it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it he probably knew everything except it seemed quirrells spell and how to get past fluffy youre the only one who knows how to get past fluffy arent you hagrid said harry anxiously and you wouldnt tell anyone would you not even one of the teachers not a soul knows except me an dumbledore said hagrid proudly well thats something harry muttered to the others hagrid can we have a window open im boiling cant harry sorry said hagrid harry noticed him glance at the fire harry looked at it too 232 norbert the norwegian ridgeback hagrid whats that but he already knew what it was in the very heart of the fire underneath the kettle was a huge black egg ah said hagrid fiddling nervously with his beard thats er where did you get it hagrid said ron crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg it mustve cost you a fortune won it said hagrid las night i was down in the village havin a few drinks an got into a game o cards with a stranger think he was quite glad ter get rid of it ter be honest but what are you going to do with it when its hatched said hermione well ive bin doin some readin said hagrid pulling a large book from under his pillow got this outta the library dragon breeding for pleasure and profit its a bit outta date o course but its all in here keep the egg in the fire cause their mothers breathe on em see an when it hatches feed it on a bucket o brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour an see here how ter recognize diff rent eggs what i got theres a norwegian ridgeback theyre rare them he looked very pleased with himself but hermione didnt hagrid you live in a wooden house she said but hagrid wasnt listening he was humming merrily as he stoked the fire so now they had something else to worry about what might happen to hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut 233 chapter fourteen wonder what its like to have a peaceful life ron sighed as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting hermione had now started making study schedules for harry and ron too it was driving them nuts then one breakfast time hedwig brought harry another note from hagrid he had written only two words its hatching ron wanted to skip herbology and go straight down to the hut hermione wouldnt hear of it hermione how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching weve got lessons well get into trouble and thats nothing to what hagrids going to be in when someone finds out what hes doing shut up harry whispered malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen how much had he heard harry didnt like the look on malfoys face at all ron and hermione argued all the way to herbology and in the end hermione agreed to run down to hagrids with the other two during morning break when the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest hagrid greeted them looking flushed and excited its nearly out he ushered them inside the egg was lying on the table there were deep cracks in it something was moving inside a funny clicking noise was coming from it they all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath 234 norbert the norwegian ridgeback all at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open the baby dragon flopped onto the table it wasnt exactly pretty harry thought it looked like a crumpled black umbrella its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body it had a long snout with wide nostrils the stubs of horns and bulging orange eyes it sneezed a couple of sparks flew out of its snout isnt he beautiful hagrid murmured he reached out a hand to stroke the dragons head it snapped at his fingers showing pointed fangs bless him look he knows his mommy said hagrid hagrid said hermione how fast do norwegian ridgebacks grow exactly hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face he leapt to his feet and ran to the window whats the matter someone was lookin through the gap in the curtains its a kid hes runnin back up ter the school harry bolted to the door and looked out even at a distance there was no mistaking him malfoy had seen the dragon something about the smile lurking on malfoys face during the next week made harry ron and hermione very nervous they spent most of their free time in hagrids darkened hut trying to reason with him just let him go harry urged set him free i cant said hagrid hes too little hed die 235 chapter fourteen they looked at the dragon it had grown three times in length in just a week smoke kept furling out of its nostrils hagrid hadnt been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy there were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor ive decided to call him norbert said hagrid looking at the dragon with misty eyes he really knows me now watch norbert norbert wheres mommy hes lost his marbles ron muttered in harrys ear hagrid said harry loudly give it two weeks and norberts going to be as long as your house malfoy could go to dumbledore at any moment hagrid bit his lip i i know i cant keep him forever but i cant jus dump him cant harry suddenly turned to ron charlie he said youre losing it too said ron im ron remember no charlie your brother charlie in romania studying dragons we could send norbert to him charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild brilliant said ron how about it hagrid and in the end hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to charlie to ask him the following week dragged by wednesday night found hermione and harry sitting alone in the common room long after everyone else had gone to bed the clock on the wall had just 236 norbert the norwegian ridgeback chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off harrys invisibility cloak he had been down at hagrids hut helping him feed norbert who was now eating dead rats by the crate it bit me he said showing them his hand which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief im not going to be able to hold a quill for a week i tell you that dragons the most horrible animal ive ever met but the way hagrid goes on about it youd think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit when it bit me he told me off for frightening it and when i left he was singing it a lullaby there was a tap on the dark window its hedwig said harry hurrying to let her in shell have charlies answer the three of them put their heads together to read the note dear ron how are you thanks for the letter id be glad to take the norwegian ridgeback but it wont be easy getting him here i think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week trouble is they mustnt be seen carrying an illegal dragon could you get the ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on saturday they can meet you there and take him away while its still dark send me an answer as soon as possible love charlie 237 chapter fourteen they looked at one another weve got the invisibility cloak said harry it shouldnt be too difficult i think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and norbert it was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him anything to get rid of norbert and malfoy there was a hitch by the next morning rons bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size he didnt know whether it was safe to go to madam pomfrey would she recognize a dragon bite by the afternoon though he had no choice the cut had turned a nasty shade of green it looked as if norberts fangs were poisonous harry and hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find ron in a terrible state in bed its not just my hand he whispered although that feels like its about to fall off malfoy told madam pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me he kept threatening to tell her what really bit me ive told her it was a dog but i dont think she believes me i shouldnt have hit him at the quidditch match thats why hes doing this harry and hermione tried to calm ron down itll all be over at midnight on saturday said hermione but this didnt soothe ron at all on the contrary he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat midnight on saturday he said in a hoarse voice oh no oh no ive just remembered charlies letter was in that book malfoy took hes going to know were getting rid of norbert 238 norbert the norwegian ridgeback harry and hermione didnt get a chance to answer madam pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave saying ron needed sleep its too late to change the plan now harry told hermione we havent got time to send charlie another owl and this could be our only chance to get rid of norbert well have to risk it and we have got the invisibility cloak malfoy doesnt know about that they found fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell hagrid who opened a window to talk to them i wont let you in he puffed norberts at a tricky stage nothin i cant handle when they told him about charlies letter his eyes filled with tears although that might have been because norbert had just bitten him on the leg aargh its all right he only got my boot jus playin hes only a baby after all the baby banged its tail on the wall making the windows rattle harry and hermione walked back to the castle feeling saturday couldnt come quickly enough they would have felt sorry for hagrid when the time came for him to say goodbye to norbert if they hadnt been so worried about what they had to do it was a very dark cloudy night and they were a bit late arriving at hagrids hut because theyd had to wait for peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall where hed been playing tennis against the wall 239 chapter fourteen hagrid had norbert packed and ready in a large crate hes got lots o rats an some brandy fer the journey said hagrid in a muffled voice an ive packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely from inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off byebye norbert hagrid sobbed as harry and hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves mommy will never forget you how they managed to get the crate back up to the castle they never knew midnight ticked nearer as they heaved norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors up another staircase then another even one of harrys shortcuts didnt make the work much easier nearly there harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate forgetting that they were already invisible they shrank into the shadows staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away a lamp flared professor mcgonagall in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net had malfoy by the ear detention she shouted and twenty points from slytherin wandering around in the middle of the night how dare you you dont understand professor harry potters coming hes got a dragon what utter rubbish how dare you tell such lies come on i shall see professor snape about you malfoy 240 norbert the norwegian ridgeback the steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that not until theyd stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak glad to be able to breathe properly again hermione did a sort of jig malfoys got detention i could sing dont harry advised her chuckling about malfoy they waited norbert thrashing about in his crate about ten minutes later four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness charlies friends were a cheery lot they showed harry and hermione the harness theyd rigged up so they could suspend norbert between them they all helped buckle norbert safely into it and then harry and hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much at last norbert was going going gone they slipped back down the spiral staircase their hearts as light as their hands now that norbert was off them no more dragon malfoy in detention what could spoil their happiness the answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs as they stepped into the corridor filchs face loomed suddenly out of the darkness well well well he whispered we are in trouble theyd left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower 241 chapter fifteen the forbidden forest t hings couldnt have been worse filch took them down to professor mcgonagalls study on the first floor where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other hermione was trembling excuses alibis and wild coverup stories chased each other around harrys brain each more feeble than the last he couldnt see how they were going to get out of trouble this time they were cornered how could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak there was no reason on earth that professor mcgonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower which was outofbounds except for classes add norbert and the invisibility cloak and they might as well be packing their bags already had harry thought that things couldnt have been worse he was wrong when professor mcgonagall appeared she was leading neville 242 the forbidden forest harry neville burst out the moment he saw the other two i was trying to find you to warn you i heard malfoy saying he was going to catch you he said you had a drag harry shook his head violently to shut neville up but professor mcgonagall had seen she looked more likely to breathe fire than norbert as she towered over the three of them i would never have believed it of any of you mr filch says you were up in the astronomy tower its one oclock in the morning explain yourselves it was the first time hermione had ever failed to answer a teachers question she was staring at her slippers as still as a statue i think ive got a good idea of whats been going on said professor mcgonagall it doesnt take a genius to work it out you fed draco malfoy some cockandbull story about a dragon trying to get him out of bed and into trouble ive already caught him i suppose you think its funny that longbottom here heard the story and believed it too harry caught nevilles eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasnt true because neville was looking stunned and hurt poor blundering neville harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark to warn them im disgusted said professor mcgonagall four students out of bed in one night ive never heard of such a thing before you miss granger i thought you had more sense as for you mr potter i thought gryffindor meant more to you than this all three of you will receive detentions yes you too mr longbottom nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night especially these days its very dangerous and fifty points will be taken from gryffindor 243 chapter fifteen fifty harry gasped they would lose the lead the lead hed won in the last quidditch match fifty points each said professor mcgonagall breathing heavily through her long pointed nose professor please you cant dont tell me what i can and cant do potter now get back to bed all of you ive never been more ashamed of gryffindor students a hundred and fifty points lost that put gryffindor in last place in one night theyd ruined any chance gryffindor had had for the house cup harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach how could they ever make up for this harry didnt sleep all night he could hear neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours harry couldnt think of anything to say to comfort him he knew neville like himself was dreading the dawn what would happen when the rest of gryffindor found out what theyd done at first gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought thered been a mistake how could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday and then the story started to spread harry potter the famous harry potter their hero of two quidditch matches had lost them all those points him and a couple of other stupid first years from being one of the most popular and admired people at the school harry was suddenly the most hated even ravenclaws and hufflepuffs turned on him because everyone had been longing to see slytherin lose the house cup everywhere harry went people 244 the forbidden forest pointed and didnt trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him slytherins on the other hand clapped as he walked past them whistling and cheering thanks potter we owe you one only ron stood by him theyll all forget this in a few weeks fred and george have lost loads of points in all the time theyve been here and people still like them theyve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go though have they said harry miserably well no ron admitted it was a bit late to repair the damage but harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that werent his business from now on hed had it with sneaking around and spying he felt so ashamed of himself that he went to wood and offered to resign from the quidditch team resign wood thundered what goodll that do how are we going to get any points back if we cant win at quidditch but even quidditch had lost its fun the rest of the team wouldnt speak to harry during practice and if they had to speak about him they called him the seeker hermione and neville were suffering too they didnt have as bad a time as harry because they werent as wellknown but nobody would speak to them either hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class keeping her head down and working in silence harry was almost glad that the exams werent far away all the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery he ron and hermione kept to themselves working late into the night trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions learn charms 245 chapter fifteen and spells by heart memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions then about a week before the exams were due to start harrys new resolution not to interfere in anything that didnt concern him was put to an unexpected test walking back from the library on his own one afternoon he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead as he drew closer he heard quirrells voice no no not again please it sounded as though someone was threatening him harry moved closer all right all right he heard quirrell sob next second quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban he was pale and looked as though he was about to cry he strode out of sight harry didnt think quirrell had even noticed him he waited until quirrells footsteps had disappeared then peered into the classroom it was empty but a door stood ajar at the other end harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what hed promised himself about not meddling all the same hed have gambled twelve sorcerers stones that snape had just left the room and from what harry had just heard snape would be walking with a new spring in his step quirrell seemed to have given in at last harry went back to the library where hermione was testing ron on astronomy harry told them what hed heard snapes done it then said ron if quirrells told him how to break his antidark force spell theres still fluffy though said hermione maybe snapes found out how to get past him without asking hagrid said ron looking up at the thousands of books sur 246 the forbidden forest rounding them i bet theres a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant threeheaded dog so what do we do harry the light of adventure was kindling again in rons eyes but hermione answered before harry could go to dumbledore thats what we should have done ages ago if we try anything ourselves well be thrown out for sure but weve got no proof said harry quirrells too scared to back us up snapes only got to say he doesnt know how the troll got in at halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor who do you think theyll believe him or us its not exactly a secret we hate him dumbledorell think we made it up to get him sacked filch wouldnt help us if his life depended on it hes too friendly with snape and the more students get thrown out the better hell think and dont forget were not supposed to know about the stone or fluffy thatll take a lot of explaining hermione looked convinced but ron didnt if we just do a bit of poking around no said harry flatly weve done enough poking around he pulled a map of jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons the following morning notes were delivered to harry hermione and neville at the breakfast table they were all the same your detention will take place at eleven oclock tonight meet mr filch in the entrance hall 247 chapter fifteen harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points theyd lost he half expected hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost but she didnt say a word like harry she felt they deserved what theyd got at eleven oclock that night they said goodbye to ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with neville filch was already there and so was malfoy harry had also forgotten that malfoy had gotten a detention too follow me said filch lighting a lamp and leading them outside i bet youll think twice about breaking a school rule again wont you eh he said leering at them oh yes hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me its just a pity they let the old punishments die out hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days ive got the chains still in my office keep em well oiled in case theyre ever needed right off we go and dont think of running off now itll be worse for you if you do they marched off across the dark grounds neville kept sniffing harry wondered what their punishment was going to be it must be something really horrible or filch wouldnt be sounding so delighted the moon was bright but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness ahead harry could see the lighted windows of hagrids hut then they heard a distant shout is that you filch hurry up i want ter get started harrys heart rose if they were going to be working with hagrid it wouldnt be so bad his relief must have showed in his face because filch said i suppose you think youll be enjoying yourself 248 the forbidden forest with that oaf well think again boy its into the forest youre going and im much mistaken if youll all come out in one piece at this neville let out a little moan and malfoy stopped dead in his tracks the forest he repeated and he didnt sound quite as cool as usual we cant go in there at night theres all sorts of things in there werewolves i heard neville clutched the sleeve of harrys robe and made a choking noise thats your problem isnt it said filch his voice cracking with glee shouldve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble shouldnt you hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark fang at his heel he was carrying his large crossbow and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder abou time he said i bin waitin fer half an hour already all right harry hermione i shouldnt be too friendly to them hagrid said filch coldly theyre here to be punished after all thats why yer late is it said hagrid frowning at filch bin lecturin them eh snot your place ter do that yehve done yer bit ill take over from here ill be back at dawn said filch for whats left of them he added nastily and he turned and started back toward the castle his lamp bobbing away in the darkness malfoy now turned to hagrid im not going in that forest he said and harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice 249 chapter fifteen yeh are if yeh want ter stay at hogwarts said hagrid fiercely yehve done wrong an now yehve got ter pay fer it but this is servant stuff its not for students to do i thought wed be copying lines or something if my father knew i was doing this hed tell yer thats how it is at hogwarts hagrid growled copyin lines what goods that ter anyone yehll do summat useful or yehll get out if yeh think yer fatherd rather you were expelled then get back off ter the castle an pack go on malfoy didnt move he looked at hagrid furiously but then dropped his gaze right then said hagrid now listen carefully cause its dangerous what were gonna do tonight an i don want no one takin risks follow me over here a moment he led them to the very edge of the forest holding his lamp up high he pointed down a narrow winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees a light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest look there said hagrid see that stuff shinin on the ground silvery stuff thats unicorn blood theres a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat this is the second time in a week i found one dead last wednesday were gonna try an find the poor thing we might have ter put it out of its misery and what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first said malfoy unable to keep the fear out of his voice theres nothin that lives in the forest thatll hurt yeh if yer with me or fang said hagrid an keep ter the path right now were gonna split inter two parties an follow the trail in diff rent direc 250 the forbidden forest tions theres blood all over the place it mustve bin staggerin around since last night at least i want fang said malfoy quickly looking at fangs long teeth all right but i warn yeh hes a coward said hagrid so me harry an hermionell go one way an draco neville an fangll go the other now if any of us finds the unicorn well send up green sparks right get yer wands out an practice now thats it an if anyone gets in trouble send up red sparks an well all come an find yeh so be careful lets go the forest was black and silent a little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path and harry hermione and hagrid took the left path while malfoy neville and fang took the right they walked in silence their eyes on the ground every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silverblue blood on the fallen leaves harry saw that hagrid looked very worried could a werewolf be killing the unicorns harry asked not fast enough said hagrid its not easy ter catch a unicorn theyre powerful magic creatures i never knew one ter be hurt before they walked past a mossy tree stump harry could hear running water there must be a stream somewhere close by there were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path you all right hermione hagrid whispered don worry it cantve gone far if its this badly hurt an then well be able ter get behind that tree hagrid seized harry and hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak he pulled out an arrow and fitted it 251 chapter fifteen into his crossbow raising it ready to fire the three of them listened something was slithering over dead leaves nearby it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground hagrid was squinting up the dark path but after a few seconds the sound faded away i knew it he murmured theres summat in here that shouldn be a werewolf harry suggested that wasn no werewolf an it wasn no unicorn neither said hagrid grimly right follow me but careful now they walked more slowly ears straining for the faintest sound suddenly in a clearing ahead something definitely moved whos there hagrid called show yerself im armed and into the clearing came was it a man or a horse to the waist a man with red hair and beard but below that was a horses gleaming chestnut body with a long reddish tail harry and hermiones jaws dropped oh its you ronan said hagrid in relief how are yeh he walked forward and shook the centaurs hand good evening to you hagrid said ronan he had a deep sorrowful voice were you going to shoot me cant be too careful ronan said hagrid patting his crossbow theres summat bad loose in this forest this is harry potter an hermione granger by the way students up at the school an this is ronan you two hes a centaur wed noticed said hermione faintly good evening said ronan students are you and do you learn much up at the school 252 the forbidden forest erm a bit said hermione timidly a bit well thats something ronan sighed he flung back his head and stared at the sky mars is bright tonight yeah said hagrid glancing up too listen im glad weve run inter yeh ronan cause theres a unicorn bin hurt you seen anythin ronan didnt answer immediately he stared unblinkingly upward then sighed again always the innocent are the first victims he said so it has been for ages past so it is now yeah said hagrid but have yeh seen anythin ronan anythin unusual mars is bright tonight ronan repeated while hagrid watched him impatiently unusually bright yeah but i was meanin anythin unusual a bit nearer home said hagrid so yeh havent noticed anythin strange yet again ronan took a while to answer at last he said the forest hides many secrets a movement in the trees behind ronan made hagrid raise his bow again but it was only a second centaur blackhaired and bodied and wilderlooking than ronan hullo bane said hagrid all right good evening hagrid i hope you are well well enough look ive jus bin askin ronan you seen anythin odd in here lately theres a unicorn bin injured would yeh know anythin about it bane walked over to stand next to ronan he looked skyward 253 chapter fifteen mars is bright tonight he said simply weve heard said hagrid grumpily well if either of you do see anythin let me know wont yeh well be off then harry and hermione followed him out of the clearing staring over their shoulders at ronan and bane until the trees blocked their view never said hagrid irritably try an get a straight answer out of a centaur ruddy stargazers not interested in anythin closern the moon are there many of them in here asked hermione oh a fair few keep themselves to themselves mostly but theyre good enough about turnin up if ever i want a word theyre deep mind centaurs they know things jus don let on much dyou think that was a centaur we heard earlier said harry did that sound like hooves to you nah if yeh ask me that was whats bin killin the unicorns never heard anythin like it before they walked on through the dense dark trees harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder he had the nasty feeling they were being watched he was very glad they had hagrid and his crossbow with them they had just passed a bend in the path when hermione grabbed hagrids arm hagrid look red sparks the others are in trouble you two wait here hagrid shouted stay on the path ill come back for yeh they heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other very scared until they couldnt hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them 254 the forbidden forest you dont think theyve been hurt do you whispered hermione i dont care if malfoy has but if somethings got neville its our fault hes here in the first place the minutes dragged by their ears seemed sharper than usual harrys seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind every cracking twig what was going on where were the others at last a great crunching noise announced hagrids return malfoy neville and fang were with him hagrid was fuming malfoy it seemed had sneaked up behind neville and grabbed him as a joke neville had panicked and sent up the sparks well be lucky ter catch anythin now with the racket you two were makin right were changin groups neville you stay with me an hermione harry you go with fang an this idiot im sorry hagrid added in a whisper to harry but hell have a harder time frightenin you an weve gotta get this done so harry set off into the heart of the forest with malfoy and fang they walked for nearly half an hour deeper and deeper into the forest until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker there were splashes on the roots of a tree as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by harry could see a clearing ahead through the tangled branches of an ancient oak look he murmured holding out his arm to stop malfoy something bright white was gleaming on the ground they inched closer it was the unicorn all right and it was dead harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad its long slender legs were stuck 255 chapter fifteen out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearlywhite on the dark leaves harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood a bush on the edge of the clearing quivered then out of the shadows a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast harry malfoy and fang stood transfixed the cloaked figure reached the unicorn lowered its head over the wound in the animals side and began to drink its blood aaaaaaaaaaargh malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted so did fang the hooded figure raised its head and looked right at harry unicorn blood was dribbling down its front it got to its feet and came swiftly toward harry he couldnt move for fear then a pain like hed never felt before pierced his head it was as though his scar were on fire half blinded he staggered backward he heard hooves behind him galloping and something jumped clean over harry charging at the figure the pain in harrys head was so bad he fell to his knees it took a minute or two to pass when he looked up the figure had gone a centaur was standing over him not ronan or bane this one looked younger he had whiteblond hair and a palomino body are you all right said the centaur pulling harry to his feet yes thank you what was that the centaur didnt answer he had astonishingly blue eyes like pale sapphires he looked carefully at harry his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out livid on harrys forehead 256 the forbidden forest you are the potter boy he said you had better get back to hagrid the forest is not safe at this time especially for you can you ride it will be quicker this way my name is firenze he added as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that harry could clamber onto his back there was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing ronan and bane came bursting through the trees their flanks heaving and sweaty firenze bane thundered what are you doing you have a human on your back have you no shame are you a common mule do you realize who this is said firenze this is the potter boy the quicker he leaves this forest the better what have you been telling him growled bane remember firenze we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets ronan pawed the ground nervously im sure firenze thought he was acting for the best he said in his gloomy voice bane kicked his back legs in anger for the best what is that to do with us centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold it is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger so that harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on do you not see that unicorn firenze bellowed at bane do you not understand why it was killed or have the planets not let you in on that secret i set myself against what is lurking in this forest bane yes with humans alongside me if i must and firenze whisked around with harry clutching on as best he 257 chapter fifteen could they plunged off into the trees leaving ronan and bane behind them harry didnt have a clue what was going on whys bane so angry he asked what was that thing you saved me from anyway firenze slowed to a walk warned harry to keep his head bowed in case of lowhanging branches but did not answer harrys question they made their way through the trees in silence for so long that harry thought firenze didnt want to talk to him anymore they were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees however when firenze suddenly stopped harry potter do you know what unicorn blood is used for no said harry startled by the odd question weve only used the horn and tail hair in potions that is because it is a monstrous thing to slay a unicorn said firenze only one who has nothing to lose and everything to gain would commit such a crime the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death but at a terrible price you have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself and you will have but a halflife a cursed life from the moment the blood touches your lips harry stared at the back of firenzes head which was dappled silver in the moonlight but whod be that desperate he wondered aloud if youre going to be cursed forever deaths better isnt it it is firenze agreed unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else something that will bring you back to full strength and power something that will mean you 258 the forbidden forest can never die mr potter do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment the sorcerers stone of course the elixir of life but i dont understand who can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power who has clung to life awaiting their chance it was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around harrys heart over the rustling of the trees he seemed to hear once more what hagrid had told him on the night they had met some say he died codswallop in my opinion dunno if he had enough human left in him to die do you mean harry croaked that was vol harry harry are you all right hermione was running toward them down the path hagrid puffing along behind her im fine said harry hardly knowing what he was saying the unicorns dead hagrid its in that clearing back there this is where i leave you firenze murmured as hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn you are safe now harry slid off his back good luck harry potter said firenze the planets have been read wrongly before now even by centaurs i hope this is one of those times he turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest leaving harry shivering behind him ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room waiting for them to return he shouted something about quidditch fouls when 259 chapter fifteen harry roughly shook him awake in a matter of seconds though he was wideeyed as harry began to tell him and hermione what had happened in the forest harry couldnt sit down he paced up and down in front of the fire he was still shaking snape wants the stone for voldemort and voldemorts waiting in the forest and all this time we thought snape just wanted to get rich stop saying the name said ron in a terrified whisper as if he thought voldemort could hear them harry wasnt listening firenze saved me but he shouldnt have done so bane was furious he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen they must show that voldemorts coming back bane thinks firenze should have let voldemort kill me i suppose thats written in the stars as well will you stop saying the name ron hissed so all ive got to wait for now is snape to steal the stone harry went on feverishly then voldemort will be able to come and finish me off well i suppose banell be happy hermione looked very frightened but she had a word of comfort harry everyone says dumbledores the only one youknowwho was ever afraid of with dumbledore around youknowwho wont touch you anyway who says the centaurs are right it sounds like fortunetelling to me and professor mcgonagall says thats a very imprecise branch of magic the sky had turned light before they stopped talking they went 260 the forbidden forest to bed exhausted their throats sore but the nights surprises werent over when harry pulled back his sheets he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them there was a note pinned to it just in case 261 chapter sixteen through the trapdoor i n years to come harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment yet the days crept by and there could be no doubt that fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door it was sweltering hot especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers they had been given special new quills for the exams which had been bewitched with an anticheating spell they had practical exams as well professor flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk professor mcgonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was but taken away if it had whiskers snape made them all nervous breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a forgetfulness potion 262 through the trapdoor harry did the best he could trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest neville thought harry had a bad case of exam nerves because harry couldnt sleep but the truth was that harry kept being woken by his old nightmare except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it maybe it was because they hadnt seen what harry had seen in the forest or because they didnt have scars burning on their foreheads but ron and hermione didnt seem as worried about the stone as harry the idea of voldemort certainly scared them but he didnt keep visiting them in dreams and they were so busy with their studying they didnt have much time to fret about what snape or anyone else might be up to their very last exam was history of magic one hour of answering questions about batty old wizards whod invented selfstirring cauldrons and theyd be free free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out when the ghost of professor binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment harry couldnt help cheering with the rest that was far easier than i thought it would be said hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds i neednt have learned about the 1637 werewolf code of conduct or the uprising of elfric the eager hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward but ron said this made him feel ill so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree the weasley twins and lee jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid which was basking in the warm shallows 263 chapter sixteen no more studying ron sighed happily stretching out on the grass you could look more cheerful harry weve got a week before we find out how badly weve done theres no need to worry yet harry was rubbing his forehead i wish i knew what this means he burst out angrily my scar keeps hurting its happened before but never as often as this go to madam pomfrey hermione suggested im not ill said harry i think its a warning it means dangers coming ron couldnt get worked up it was too hot harry relax hermiones right the stones safe as long as dumbledores around anyway weve never had any proof snape found out how to get past fluffy he nearly had his leg ripped off once hes not going to try it again in a hurry and neville will play quidditch for england before hagrid lets dumbledore down harry nodded but he couldnt shake off a lurking feeling that there was something hed forgotten to do something important when he tried to explain this hermione said thats just the exams i woke up last night and was halfway through my transfiguration notes before i remembered wed done that one harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didnt have anything to do with work though he watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky a note clamped in its mouth hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters hagrid would never betray dumbledore hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past fluffy never but harry suddenly jumped to his feet 264 through the trapdoor wherere you going said ron sleepily ive just thought of something said harry he had turned white weve got to go and see hagrid now why panted hermione hurrying to keep up dont you think its a bit odd said harry scrambling up the grassy slope that what hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket how many people wander around with dragon eggs if its against wizard law lucky they found hagrid dont you think why didnt i see it before what are you talking about said ron but harry sprinting across the grounds toward the forest didnt answer hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house his trousers and sleeves were rolled up and he was shelling peas into a large bowl hullo he said smiling finished yer exams got time fer a drink yes please said ron but harry cut him off no were in a hurry hagrid ive got to ask you something you know that night you won norbert what did the stranger you were playing cards with look like dunno said hagrid casually he wouldn take his cloak off he saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows its not that unusual yeh get a lot o funny folk in the hogs head thats one o the pubs down in the village mighta bin a dragon dealer mightn he i never saw his face he kept his hood up harry sank down next to the bowl of peas 265 chapter sixteen what did you talk to him about hagrid did you mention hogwarts at all mighta come up said hagrid frowning as he tried to remember yeah he asked what i did an i told him i was gamekeeper here he asked a bit about the sorta creatures i look after so i told him an i said what id always really wanted was a dragon an then i can remember too well cause he kept buyin me drinks lets see yeah then he said he had the dragon egg an we could play cards fer it if i wanted but he had ter be sure i could handle it he didn want it ter go ter any old home so i told him after fluffy a dragon would be easy and did he did he seem interested in fluffy harry asked trying to keep his voice calm well yeah how many threeheaded dogs dyeh meet even around hogwarts so i told him fluffys a piece o cake if yeh know how to calm him down jus play him a bit o music an hell go straight off ter sleep hagrid suddenly looked horrified i shouldnta told yeh that he blurted out forget i said it hey wherere yeh goin harry ron and hermione didnt speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds weve got to go to dumbledore said harry hagrid told that stranger how to get past fluffy and it was either snape or voldemort under that cloak it mustve been easy once hed got hagrid drunk i just hope dumbledore believes us firenze might back us up if bane doesnt stop him wheres dumbledores office 266 through the trapdoor they looked around as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction they had never been told where dumbledore lived nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him well just have to harry began but a voice suddenly rang across the hall what are you three doing inside it was professor mcgonagall carrying a large pile of books we want to see professor dumbledore said hermione rather bravely harry and ron thought see professor dumbledore professor mcgonagall repeated as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do why harry swallowed now what its sort of secret he said but he wished at once he hadnt because professor mcgonagalls nostrils flared professor dumbledore left ten minutes ago she said coldly he received an urgent owl from the ministry of magic and flew off for london at once hes gone said harry frantically now professor dumbledore is a very great wizard potter he has many demands on his time but this is important something you have to say is more important than the ministry of magic potter look said harry throwing caution to the winds professor its about the sorcerers stone whatever professor mcgonagall had expected it wasnt that the books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms but she didnt pick them up 267 chapter sixteen how do you know she spluttered professor i think i know that sn that someones going to try and steal the stone ive got to talk to professor dumbledore she eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion professor dumbledore will be back tomorrow she said finally i dont know how you found out about the stone but rest assured no one can possibly steal it its too well protected but professor potter i know what im talking about she said shortly she bent down and gathered up the fallen books i suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine but they didnt its tonight said harry once he was sure professor mcgonagall was out of earshot snapes going through the trapdoor tonight hes found out everything he needs and now hes got dumbledore out of the way he sent that note i bet the ministry of magic will get a real shock when dumbledore turns up but what can we hermione gasped harry and ron wheeled round snape was standing there good afternoon he said smoothly they stared at him you shouldnt be inside on a day like this he said with an odd twisted smile we were harry began without any idea what he was going to say you want to be more careful said snape hanging around 268 through the trapdoor like this people will think youre up to something and gryffindor really cant afford to lose any more points can it harry flushed they turned to go outside but snape called them back be warned potter any more nighttime wanderings and i will personally make sure you are expelled good day to you he strode off in the direction of the staffroom out on the stone steps harry turned to the others right heres what weve got to do he whispered urgently one of us has got to keep an eye on snape wait outside the staffroom and follow him if he leaves it hermione youd better do that why me its obvious said ron you can pretend to be waiting for professor flitwick you know he put on a high voice oh professor flitwick im so worried i think i got question fourteen b wrong oh shut up said hermione but she agreed to go and watch out for snape and wed better stay outside the thirdfloor corridor harry told ron come on but that part of the plan didnt work no sooner had they reached the door separating fluffy from the rest of the school than professor mcgonagall turned up again and this time she lost her temper i suppose you think youre harder to get past than a pack of enchantments she stormed enough of this nonsense if i hear youve come anywhere near here again ill take another fifty points from gryffindor yes weasley from my own house 269 chapter sixteen harry and ron went back to the common room harry had just said at least hermiones on snapes tail when the portrait of the fat lady swung open and hermione came in im sorry harry she wailed snape came out and asked me what i was doing so i said i was waiting for flitwick and snape went to get him and ive only just got away i dont know where snape went well thats it then isnt it harry said the other two stared at him he was pale and his eyes were glittering im going out of here tonight and im going to try and get to the stone first youre mad said ron you cant said hermione after what mcgonagall and snape have said youll be expelled so what harry shouted dont you understand if snape gets hold of the stone voldemorts coming back havent you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over there wont be any hogwarts to get expelled from hell flatten it or turn it into a school for the dark arts losing points doesnt matter anymore cant you see dyou think hell leave you and your families alone if gryffindor wins the house cup if i get caught before i can get to the stone well ill have to go back to the dursleys and wait for voldemort to find me there its only dying a bit later than i would have because im never going over to the dark side im going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me voldemort killed my parents remember he glared at them 270 through the trapdoor youre right harry said hermione in a small voice ill use the invisibility cloak said harry its just lucky i got it back but will it cover all three of us said ron all all three of us oh come off it you dont think wed let you go alone of course not said hermione briskly how do you think youd get to the stone without us id better go and look through my books there might be something useful but if we get caught you two will be expelled too not if i can help it said hermione grimly flitwick told me in secret that i got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam theyre not throwing me out after that after dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room nobody bothered them none of the gryffindors had anything to say to harry any more after all this was the first night he hadnt been upset by it hermione was skimming through all her notes hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break harry and ron didnt talk much both of them were thinking about what they were about to do slowly the room emptied as people drifted off to bed better get the cloak ron muttered as lee jordan finally left stretching and yawning harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory he pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute hagrid had given him for christmas he pocketed it to use on fluffy he didnt feel much like singing he ran back down to the common room 271 chapter sixteen wed better put the cloak on here and make sure it covers all three of us if filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own what are you doing said a voice from the corner of the room neville appeared from behind an armchair clutching trevor the toad who looked as though hed been making another bid for freedom nothing neville nothing said harry hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back neville stared at their guilty faces youre going out again he said no no no said hermione no were not why dont you go to bed neville harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door they couldnt afford to waste any more time snape might even now be playing fluffy to sleep you cant go out said neville youll be caught again gryffindor will be in even more trouble you dont understand said harry this is important but neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate i wont let you do it he said hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole ill ill fight you neville ron exploded get away from that hole and dont be an idiot dont you call me an idiot said neville i dont think you should be breaking any more rules and you were the one who told me to stand up to people 272 through the trapdoor yes but not to us said ron in exasperation neville you dont know what youre doing he took a step forward and neville dropped trevor the toad who leapt out of sight go on then try and hit me said neville raising his fists im ready harry turned to hermione do something he said desperately hermione stepped forward neville she said im really really sorry about this she raised her wand petrificus totalus she cried pointing it at neville nevilles arms snapped to his sides his legs sprang together his whole body rigid he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face stiff as a board hermione ran to turn him over nevilles jaws were jammed together so he couldnt speak only his eyes were moving looking at them in horror whatve you done to him harry whispered its the full bodybind said hermione miserably oh neville im so sorry we had to neville no time to explain said harry youll understand later neville said ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak but leaving neville lying motionless on the floor didnt feel like a very good omen in their nervous state every statues shadow looked like filch every distant breath of wind sounded like peeves swooping down on them 273 chapter sixteen at the foot of the first set of stairs they spotted mrs norris skulking near the top oh lets kick her just this once ron whispered in harrys ear but harry shook his head as they climbed carefully around her mrs norris turned her lamplike eyes on them but didnt do anything they didnt meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor peeves was bobbing halfway up loosening the carpet so that people would trip whos there he said suddenly as they climbed toward him he narrowed his wicked black eyes know youre there even if i cant see you are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie he rose up in the air and floated there squinting at them should call filch i should if somethings acreeping around unseen harry had a sudden idea peeves he said in a hoarse whisper the bloody baron has his own reasons for being invisible peeves almost fell out of the air in shock he caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs so sorry your bloodiness mr baron sir he said greasily my mistake my mistake i didnt see you of course i didnt youre invisible forgive old peevsie his little joke sir i have business here peeves croaked harry stay away from this place tonight i will sir i most certainly will said peeves rising up in the air again hope your business goes well baron ill not bother you and he scooted off 274 through the trapdoor brilliant harry whispered ron a few seconds later they were there outside the thirdfloor corridor and the door was already ajar well there you are harry said quietly snapes already got past fluffy seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them underneath the cloak harry turned to the other two if you want to go back i wont blame you he said you can take the cloak i wont need it now dont be stupid said ron were coming said hermione harry pushed the door open as the door creaked low rumbling growls met their ears all three of the dogs noses sniffed madly in their direction even though it couldnt see them whats that at its feet hermione whispered looks like a harp said ron snape must have left it there it must wake up the moment you stop playing said harry well here goes he put hagrids flute to his lips and blew it wasnt really a tune but from the first note the beasts eyes began to droop harry hardly drew breath slowly the dogs growls ceased it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees then it slumped to the ground fast asleep keep playing ron warned harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor they could feel the dogs hot smelly breath as they approached the giant heads 275 chapter sixteen i think well be able to pull the door open said ron peering over the dogs back want to go first hermione no i dont all right ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dogs legs he bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor which swung up and open what can you see hermione said anxiously nothing just black theres no way of climbing down well just have to drop harry who was still playing the flute waved at ron to get his attention and pointed at himself you want to go first are you sure said ron i dont know how deep this thing goes give the flute to hermione so she can keep him asleep harry handed the flute over in the few seconds silence the dog growled and twitched but the moment hermione began to play it fell back into its deep sleep harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor there was no sign of the bottom he lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips then he looked up at ron and said if anything happens to me dont follow go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore right right said ron see you in a minute i hope and harry let go cold damp air rushed past him as he fell down down down and flump with a funny muffled sort of thump he landed on 276 through the trapdoor something soft he sat up and felt around his eyes not used to the gloom it felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant its okay he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp which was the open trapdoor its a soft landing you can jump ron followed right away he landed sprawled next to harry whats this stuff were his first words dunno some sort of plant thing i suppose its here to break the fall come on hermione the distant music stopped there was a loud bark from the dog but hermione had already jumped she landed on harrys other side we must be miles under the school she said lucky this plant things here really said ron lucky shrieked hermione look at you both she leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall she had to struggle because the moment she had landed the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles as for harry and ron their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them but the more they strained against it the tighter and faster the plant wound around them stop moving hermione ordered them i know what this is its devils snare oh im so glad we know what its called thats a great help snarled ron leaning back trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck 277 chapter sixteen shut up im trying to remember how to kill it said hermione well hurry up i cant breathe harry gasped wrestling with it as it curled around his chest devils snare devils snare what did professor sprout say it likes the dark and the damp so light a fire harry choked yes of course but theres no wood hermione cried wringing her hands have you gone mad ron bellowed are you a witch or not oh right said hermione and she whipped out her wand waved it muttered something and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on snape at the plant in a matter of seconds the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth wriggling and flailing it unraveled itself from their bodies and they were able to pull free lucky you pay attention in herbology hermione said harry as he joined her by the wall wiping sweat off his face yeah said ron and lucky harry doesnt lose his head in a crisis theres no wood honestly this way said harry pointing down a stone passageway which was the only way forward all they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls the passageway sloped downward and harry was reminded of gringotts with an unpleasant jolt of the heart he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards bank if they met a dragon a fullygrown dragon norbert had been bad enough 278 through the trapdoor can you hear something ron whispered harry listened a soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead do you think its a ghost i dont know sounds like wings to me theres light ahead i can see something moving they reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber its ceiling arching high above them it was full of small jewelbright birds fluttering and tumbling all around the room on the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door do you think theyll attack us if we cross the room said ron probably said harry they dont look very vicious but i suppose if they all swooped down at once well theres no other choice ill run he took a deep breath covered his face with his arms and sprinted across the room he expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second but nothing happened he reached the door untouched he pulled the handle but it was locked the other two followed him they tugged and heaved at the door but it wouldnt budge not even when hermione tried her alohomora charm now what said ron these birds they cant be here just for decoration said hermione they watched the birds soaring overhead glittering glittering theyre not birds harry said suddenly theyre keys winged keys look carefully so that must mean he looked around 279 chapter sixteen the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys yes look broomsticks weve got to catch the key to the door but there are hundreds of them ron examined the lock on the door were looking for a big oldfashioned one probably silver like the handle they each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys they grabbed and snatched but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one not for nothing though was harry the youngest seeker in a century he had a knack for spotting things other people didnt after a minutes weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole that one he called to the others that big one there no there with bright blue wings the feathers are all crumpled on one side ron went speeding in the direction that harry was pointing crashed into the ceiling and nearly fell off his broom weve got to close in on it harry called not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing ron you come at it from above hermione stay below and stop it from going down and ill try and catch it right now ron dived hermione rocketed upward the key dodged them both and harry streaked after it it sped toward the wall harry leaned forward and with a nasty crunching noise pinned it against 280 through the trapdoor the stone with one hand ron and hermiones cheers echoed around the high chamber they landed quickly and harry ran to the door the key struggling in his hand he rammed it into the lock and turned it worked the moment the lock had clicked open the key took flight again looking very battered now that it had been caught twice ready harry asked the other two his hand on the door handle they nodded he pulled the door open the next chamber was so dark they couldnt see anything at all but as they stepped into it light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight they were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard behind the black chessmen which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone facing them way across the chamber were the white pieces harry ron and hermione shivered slightly the towering white chessmen had no faces now what do we do harry whispered its obvious isnt it said ron weve got to play our way across the room behind the white pieces they could see another door how said hermione nervously i think said ron were going to have to be chessmen he walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knights horse at once the stone sprang to life the horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at ron do we er have to join you to get across 281 chapter sixteen the black knight nodded ron turned to the other two this needs thinking about he said i suppose weve got to take the place of three of the black pieces harry and hermione stayed quiet watching ron think finally he said now dont be offended or anything but neither of you are that good at chess were not offended said harry quickly just tell us what to do well harry you take the place of that bishop and hermione you go there instead of that castle what about you im going to be a knight said ron the chessmen seemed to have been listening because at these words a knight a bishop and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board leaving three empty squares that harry ron and hermione took white always plays first in chess said ron peering across the board yes look a white pawn had moved forward two squares ron started to direct the black pieces they moved silently wherever he sent them harrys knees were trembling what if they lost harry move diagonally four squares to the right their first real shock came when their other knight was taken the white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board where he lay quite still facedown had to let that happen said ron looking shaken leaves you free to take that bishop hermione go on 282 through the trapdoor every time one of their men was lost the white pieces showed no mercy soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall twice ron only just noticed in time that harry and hermione were in danger he himself darted around the board taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones were nearly there he muttered suddenly let me think let me think the white queen turned her blank face toward him yes said ron softly its the only way ive got to be taken no harry and hermione shouted thats chess snapped ron youve got to make some sacrifices i make my move and shell take me that leaves you free to checkmate the king harry but do you want to stop snape or not ron look if you dont hurry up hell already have the stone there was no alternative ready ron called his face pale but determined here i go now dont hang around once youve won he stepped forward and the white queen pounced she struck ron hard across the head with her stone arm and he crashed to the floor hermione screamed but stayed on her square the white queen dragged ron to one side he looked as if hed been knocked out shaking harry moved three spaces to the left 283 chapter sixteen the white king took off his crown and threw it at harrys feet they had won the chessmen parted and bowed leaving the door ahead clear with one last desperate look back at ron harry and hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway what if hes hell be all right said harry trying to convince himself what do you reckons next weve had sprouts that was the devils snare flitwick mustve put charms on the keys mcgonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive that leaves quirrells spell and snapes they had reached another door all right harry whispered go on harry pushed it open a disgusting smell filled their nostrils making both of them pull their robes up over their noses eyes watering they saw flat on the floor in front of them a troll even larger than the one they had tackled out cold with a bloody lump on its head im glad we didnt have to fight that one harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs come on i cant breathe he pulled open the next door both of them hardly daring to look at what came next but there was nothing very frightening in here just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line snapes said harry what do we have to do they stepped over the threshold and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway it wasnt ordinary fire either it was 284 through the trapdoor purple at the same instant black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward they were trapped look hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles harry looked over her shoulder to read it danger lies before you while safety lies behind two of us will help you whichever you would find one among us seven will let you move ahead another will transport the drinker back instead two among our number hold only nettle wine three of us are killers waiting hidden in line choose unless you wish to stay here forevermore to help you in your choice we give you these clues four first however slyly the poison tries to hide you will always find some on nettle wines left side second different are those who stand at either end but if you would move onward neither is your friend third as you see clearly all are different size neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides fourth the second left and the second on the right are twins once you taste them though different at first sight hermione let out a great sigh and harry amazed saw that she was smiling the very last thing he felt like doing brilliant said hermione this isnt magic its logic a puzzle a lot of the greatest wizards havent got an ounce of logic theyd be stuck in here forever but so will we wont we 285 chapter sixteen of course not said hermione everything we need is here on this paper seven bottles three are poison two are wine one will get us safely through the black fire and one will get us back through the purple but how do we know which to drink give me a minute hermione read the paper several times then she walked up and down the line of bottles muttering to herself and pointing at them at last she clapped her hands got it she said the smallest bottle will get us through the black fire toward the stone harry looked at the tiny bottle theres only enough there for one of us he said thats hardly one swallow they looked at each other which one will get you back through the purple flames hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line you drink that said harry no listen get back and get ron grab brooms from the flyingkey room theyll get you out of the trapdoor and past fluffy go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore we need him i might be able to hold snape off for a while but im no match for him really but harry what if youknowwhos with him well i was lucky once wasnt i said harry pointing at his scar i might get lucky again hermiones lip trembled and she suddenly dashed at harry and threw her arms around him 286 through the trapdoor hermione harry youre a great wizard you know im not as good as you said harry very embarrassed as she let go of him me said hermione books and cleverness there are more important things friendship and bravery and oh harry be careful you drink first said harry you are sure which is which arent you positive said hermione she took a long drink from the round bottle at the end and shuddered its not poison said harry anxiously no but its like ice quick go before it wears off good luck take care go hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle he turned to face the black flames here i come he said and he drained the little bottle in one gulp it was indeed as though ice was flooding his body he put the bottle down and walked forward he braced himself saw the black flames licking his body but couldnt feel them for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire then he was on the other side in the last chamber there was already someone there but it wasnt snape it wasnt even voldemort 287 chapter seventeen the man with two faces i t was quirrell you gasped harry quirrell smiled his face wasnt twitching at all me he said calmly i wondered whether id be meeting you here potter but i thought snape severus quirrell laughed and it wasnt his usual quivering treble either but cold and sharp yes severus does seem the type doesnt he so useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat next to him who would suspect pppoor ststuttering pprofessor quirrell harry couldnt take it in this couldnt be true it couldnt but snape tried to kill me no no no i tried to kill you your friend miss granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to snape at that quidditch match she broke my eye contact with you another 288 the man with two faces few seconds and id have got you off that broom id have managed it before then if snape hadnt been muttering a countercurse trying to save you snape was trying to save me of course said quirrell coolly why do you think he wanted to referee your next match he was trying to make sure i didnt do it again funny really he neednt have bothered i couldnt do anything with dumbledore watching all the other teachers thought snape was trying to stop gryffindor from winning he did make himself unpopular and what a waste of time when after all that im going to kill you tonight quirrell snapped his fingers ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around harry youre too nosy to live potter scurrying around the school on halloween like that for all i knew youd seen me coming to look at what was guarding the stone you let the troll in certainly i have a special gift with trolls you must have seen what i did to the one in the chamber back there unfortunately while everyone else was running around looking for it snape who already suspected me went straight to the third floor to head me off and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death that threeheaded dog didnt even manage to bite snapes leg off properly now wait quietly potter i need to examine this interesting mirror it was only then that harry realized what was standing behind quirrell it was the mirror of erised this mirror is the key to finding the stone quirrell mur 289 chapter seventeen mured tapping his way around the frame trust dumbledore to come up with something like this but hes in london ill be far away by the time he gets back all harry could think of doing was to keep quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror i saw you and snape in the forest he blurted out yes said quirrell idly walking around the mirror to look at the back he was on to me by that time trying to find out how far id got he suspected me all along tried to frighten me as though he could when i had lord voldemort on my side quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it i see the stone im presenting it to my master but where is it harry struggled against the ropes binding him but they didnt give he had to keep quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror but snape always seemed to hate me so much oh he does said quirrell casually heavens yes he was at hogwarts with your father didnt you know they loathed each other but he never wanted you dead but i heard you a few days ago sobbing i thought snape was threatening you for the first time a spasm of fear flitted across quirrells face sometimes he said i find it hard to follow my masters instructions he is a great wizard and i am weak you mean he was there in the classroom with you harry gasped 290 the man with two faces he is with me wherever i go said quirrell quietly i met him when i traveled around the world a foolish young man i was then full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil lord voldemort showed me how wrong i was there is no good and evil there is only power and those too weak to seek it since then i have served him faithfully although i have let him down many times he has had to be very hard on me quirrell shivered suddenly he does not forgive mistakes easily when i failed to steal the stone from gringotts he was most displeased he punished me decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me quirrells voice trailed away harry was remembering his trip to diagon alley how could he have been so stupid hed seen quirrell there that very day shaken hands with him in the leaky cauldron quirrell cursed under his breath i dont understand is the stone inside the mirror should i break it harrys mind was racing what i want more than anything else in the world at the moment he thought is to find the stone before quirrell does so if i look in the mirror i should see myself finding it which means ill see where its hidden but how can i look without quirrell realizing what im up to he tried to edge to the left to get in front of the glass without quirrell noticing but the ropes around his ankles were too tight he tripped and fell over quirrell ignored him he was still talking to himself 291 chapter seventeen what does this mirror do how does it work help me master and to harrys horror a voice answered and the voice seemed to come from quirrell himself use the boy use the boy quirrell rounded on harry yes potter come here he clapped his hands once and the ropes binding harry fell off harry got slowly to his feet come here quirrell repeated look in the mirror and tell me what you see harry walked toward him i must lie he thought desperately i must look and lie about what i see thats all quirrell moved close behind him harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from quirrells turban he closed his eyes stepped in front of the mirror and opened them again he saw his reflection pale and scaredlooking at first but a moment later the reflection smiled at him it put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a bloodred stone it winked and put the stone back in its pocket and as it did so harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket somehow incredibly hed gotten the stone well said quirrell impatiently what do you see harry screwed up his courage i see myself shaking hands with dumbledore he invented i ive won the house cup for gryffindor quirrell cursed again 292 the man with two faces get out of the way he said as harry moved aside he felt the sorcerers stone against his leg dare he make a break for it but he hadnt walked five paces before a high voice spoke though quirrell wasnt moving his lips he lies he lies potter come back here quirrell shouted tell me the truth what did you just see the high voice spoke again let me speak to him facetoface master you are not strong enough i have strength enough for this harry felt as if devils snare was rooting him to the spot he couldnt move a muscle petrified he watched as quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban what was going on the turban fell away quirrells head looked strangely small without it then he turned slowly on the spot harry would have screamed but he couldnt make a sound where there should have been a back to quirrells head there was a face the most terrible face harry had ever seen it was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils like a snake harry potter it whispered harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldnt move see what i have become the face said mere shadow and vapor i have form only when i can share anothers body but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds unicorn blood has strengthened me these past weeks you saw faithful quirrell drinking it for me in the forest and once i have the elixir of life i will be able to create a 293 chapter seventeen body of my own now why dont you give me that stone in your pocket so he knew the feeling suddenly surged back into harrys legs he stumbled backward dont be a fool snarled the face better save your own life and join me or youll meet the same end as your parents they died begging me for mercy liar harry shouted suddenly quirrell was walking backward at him so that voldemort could still see him the evil face was now smiling how touching it hissed i always value bravery yes boy your parents were brave i killed your father first and he put up a courageous fight but your mother neednt have died she was trying to protect you now give me the stone unless you want her to have died in vain never harry sprang toward the flame door but voldemort screamed seize him and the next second harry felt quirrells hand close on his wrist at once a needlesharp pain seared across harrys scar his head felt as though it was about to split in two he yelled struggling with all his might and to his surprise quirrell let go of him the pain in his head lessened he looked around wildly to see where quirrell had gone and saw him hunched in pain looking at his fingers they were blistering before his eyes seize him seize him shrieked voldemort again and quirrell lunged knocking harry clean off his feet landing on top of him both hands around harrys neck harrys scar was almost blinding him with pain yet he could see quirrell howling in agony 294 the man with two faces master i cannot hold him my hands my hands and quirrell though pinning harry to the ground with his knees let go of his neck and stared bewildered at his own palms harry could see they looked burned raw red and shiny then kill him fool and be done screeched voldemort quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse but harry by instinct reached up and grabbed quirrells face aaaargh quirrell rolled off him his face blistering too and then harry knew quirrell couldnt touch his bare skin not without suffering terrible pain his only chance was to keep hold of quirrell keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse harry jumped to his feet caught quirrell by the arm and hung on as tight as he could quirrell screamed and tried to throw harry off the pain in harrys head was building he couldnt see he could only hear quirrells terrible shrieks and voldemorts yells of kill him kill him and other voices maybe in harrys own head crying harry harry he felt quirrells arm wrenched from his grasp knew all was lost and fell into blackness down down down something gold was glinting just above him the snitch he tried to catch it but his arms were too heavy he blinked it wasnt the snitch at all it was a pair of glasses how strange he blinked again the smiling face of albus dumbledore swam into view above him good afternoon harry said dumbledore 295 chapter seventeen harry stared at him then he remembered sir the stone it was quirrell hes got the stone sir quick calm yourself dear boy you are a little behind the times said dumbledore quirrell does not have the stone then who does sir i harry please relax or madam pomfrey will have me thrown out harry swallowed and looked around him he realized he must be in the hospital wing he was lying in a bed with white linen sheets and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop tokens from your friends and admirers said dumbledore beaming what happened down in the dungeons between you and professor quirrell is a complete secret so naturally the whole school knows i believe your friends misters fred and george weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat no doubt they thought it would amuse you madam pomfrey however felt it might not be very hygienic and confiscated it how long have i been in here three days mr ronald weasley and miss granger will be most relieved you have come round they have been extremely worried but sir the stone i see you are not to be distracted very well the stone professor quirrell did not manage to take it from you i arrived in time to prevent that although you were doing very well on your own i must say you got there you got hermiones owl 296 the man with two faces we must have crossed in midair no sooner had i reached london than it became clear to me that the place i should be was the one i had just left i arrived just in time to pull quirrell off you it was you i feared i might be too late you nearly were i couldnt have kept him off the stone much longer not the stone boy you the effort involved nearly killed you for one terrible moment there i was afraid it had as for the stone it has been destroyed destroyed said harry blankly but your friend nicolas flamel oh you know about nicolas said dumbledore sounding quite delighted you did do the thing properly didnt you well nicolas and i have had a little chat and agreed its all for the best but that means he and his wife will die wont they they have enough elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then yes they will die dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on harrys face to one as young as you im sure it seems incredible but to nicolas and perenelle it really is like going to bed after a very very long day after all to the wellorganized mind death is but the next great adventure you know the stone was really not such a wonderful thing as much money and life as you could want the two things most human beings would choose above all the trouble is humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them 297 chapter seventeen harry lay there lost for words dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling sir said harry ive been thinking sir even if the stones gone vol i mean youknowwho call him voldemort harry always use the proper name for things fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself yes sir well voldemorts going to try other ways of coming back isnt he i mean he hasnt gone has he no harry he has not he is still out there somewhere perhaps looking for another body to share not being truly alive he cannot be killed he left quirrell to die he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies nevertheless harry while you may only have delayed his return to power it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time and if he is delayed again and again why he may never return to power harry nodded but stopped quickly because it made his head hurt then he said sir there are some other things id like to know if you can tell me things i want to know the truth about the truth dumbledore sighed it is a beautiful and terrible thing and should therefore be treated with great caution however i shall answer your questions unless i have a very good reason not to in which case i beg youll forgive me i shall not of course lie well voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me but why would he want to kill me in the first place 298 the man with two faces dumbledore sighed very deeply this time alas the first thing you ask me i cannot tell you not today not now you will know one day put it from your mind for now harry when you are older i know you hate to hear this when you are ready you will know and harry knew it would be no good to argue but why couldnt quirrell touch me your mother died to save you if there is one thing voldemort cannot understand it is love he didnt realize that love as powerful as your mothers for you leaves its own mark not a scar no visible sign to have been loved so deeply even though the person who loved us is gone will give us some protection forever it is in your very skin quirrell full of hatred greed and ambition sharing his soul with voldemort could not touch you for this reason it was agony to touch a person marked by something so good dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill which gave harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet when he had found his voice again harry said and the invisibility cloak do you know who sent it to me ah your father happened to leave it in my possession and i thought you might like it dumbledores eyes twinkled useful things your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here and theres something else fire away quirrell said snape professor snape harry 299 chapter seventeen yes him quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father is that true well they did rather detest each other not unlike yourself and mr malfoy and then your father did something snape could never forgive what he saved his life what yes said dumbledore dreamily funny the way peoples minds work isnt it professor snape couldnt bear being in your fathers debt i do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even then he could go back to hating your fathers memory in peace harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound so he stopped and sir theres one more thing just the one how did i get the stone out of the mirror ah now im glad you asked me that it was one of my more brilliant ideas and between you and me thats saying something you see only one who wanted to find the stone find it but not use it would be able to get it otherwise theyd just see themselves making gold or drinking elixir of life my brain surprises even me sometimes now enough questions i suggest you make a start on these sweets ah bertie botts every flavor beans i was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one and since then im afraid ive rather lost my liking for them but i think ill be safe with a nice toffee dont you 300 the man with two faces he smiled and popped the goldenbrown bean into his mouth then he choked and said alas ear wax madam pomfrey the nurse was a nice woman but very strict just five minutes harry pleaded absolutely not you let professor dumbledore in well of course that was the headmaster quite different you need rest i am resting look lying down and everything oh go on madam pomfrey oh very well she said but five minutes only and she let ron and hermione in harry hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again but harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore oh harry we were sure you were going to dumbledore was so worried the whole schools talking about it said ron what really happened it was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors harry told them everything quirrell the mirror the stone and voldemort ron and hermione were a very good audience they gasped in all the right places and when harry told them what was under quirrells turban hermione screamed out loud so the stones gone said ron finally flamels just going to die thats what i said but dumbledore thinks that what was 301 chapter seventeen it to the wellorganized mind death is but the next great adventure i always said he was off his rocker said ron looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was so what happened to you two said harry well i got back all right said hermione i brought ron round that took a while and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall he already knew he just said harrys gone after him hasnt he and hurtled off to the third floor dyou think he meant you to do it said ron sending you your fathers cloak and everything well hermione exploded if he did i mean to say thats terrible you could have been killed no it isnt said harry thoughtfully hes a funny man dumbledore i think he sort of wanted to give me a chance i think he knows more or less everything that goes on here you know i reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try and instead of stopping us he just taught us enough to help i dont think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked its almost like he thought i had the right to face voldemort if i could yeah dumbledores off his rocker all right said ron proudly listen youve got to be up for the endofyear feast tomorrow the points are all in and slytherin won of course you missed the last quidditch match we were steamrollered by ravenclaw without you but the foodll be good at that moment madam pomfrey bustled over youve had nearly fifteen minutes now out she said firmly 302 the man with two faces after a good nights sleep harry felt nearly back to normal i want to go to the feast he told madam pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes i can cant i professor dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go she said sniffily as though in her opinion professor dumbledore didnt realize how risky feasts could be and you have another visitor oh good said harry who is it hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke as usual when he was indoors hagrid looked too big to be allowed he sat down next to harry took one look at him and burst into tears its all my ruddy fault he sobbed his face in his hands i told the evil git how ter get past fluffy i told him it was the only thing he didnt know an i told him yeh couldve died all fer a dragon egg ill never drink again i should be chucked out an made ter live as a muggle hagrid said harry shocked to see hagrid shaking with grief and remorse great tears leaking down into his beard hagrid hed have found out somehow this is voldemort were talking about hed have found out even if you hadnt told him yeh couldve died sobbed hagrid an don say the name voldemort harry bellowed and hagrid was so shocked he stopped crying ive met him and im calling him by his name please cheer up hagrid we saved the stone its gone he cant use it have a chocolate frog ive got loads hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said that reminds me ive got yeh a present its not a stoat sandwich is it said harry anxiously and at last hagrid gave a weak chuckle 303 chapter seventeen nah dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it course he shoulda sacked me instead anyway got yeh this it seemed to be a handsome leathercovered book harry opened it curiously it was full of wizard photographs smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father sent owls off ter all yer parents old school friends askin fer photos knew yeh didn have any dyeh like it harry couldnt speak but hagrid understood harry made his way down to the endofyear feast alone that night he had been held up by madam pomfreys fussing about insisting on giving him one last checkup so the great hall was already full it was decked out in the slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate slytherins winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row a huge banner showing the slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the high table when harry walked in there was a sudden hush and then everybody started talking loudly at once he slipped into a seat between ron and hermione at the gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him fortunately dumbledore arrived moments later the babble died away another year gone dumbledore said cheerfully and i must trouble you with an old mans wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast what a year it has been hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts 304 the man with two faces now as i understand it the house cup here needs awarding and the points stand thus in fourth place gryffindor with three hundred and twelve points in third hufflepuff with three hundred and fiftytwo ravenclaw has four hundred and twentysix and slytherin four hundred and seventytwo a storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the slytherin table harry could see draco malfoy banging his goblet on the table it was a sickening sight yes yes well done slytherin said dumbledore however recent events must be taken into account the room went very still the slytherins smiles faded a little ahem said dumbledore i have a few lastminute points to dish out let me see yes first to mr ronald weasley ron went purple in the face he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn for the bestplayed game of chess hogwarts has seen in many years i award gryffindor house fifty points gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling the stars overhead seemed to quiver percy could be heard telling the other prefects my brother you know my youngest brother got past mcgonagalls giant chess set at last there was silence again second to miss hermione granger for the use of cool logic in the face of fire i award gryffindor house fifty points hermione buried her face in her arms harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves they were a hundred points up 305 chapter seventeen third to mr harry potter said dumbledore the room went deadly quiet for pure nerve and outstanding courage i award gryffindor house sixty points the din was deafening those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that gryffindor now had four hundred and seventytwo points exactly the same as slytherin they had tied for the house cup if only dumbledore had given harry just one more point dumbledore raised his hand the room gradually fell silent there are all kinds of courage said dumbledore smiling it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies but just as much to stand up to our friends i therefore award ten points to mr neville longbottom someone standing outside the great hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place so loud was the noise that erupted from the gryffindor table harry ron and hermione stood up to yell and cheer as neville white with shock disappeared under a pile of people hugging him he had never won so much as a point for gryffindor before harry still cheering nudged ron in the ribs and pointed at malfoy who couldnt have looked more stunned and horrified if hed just had the bodybind curse put on him which means dumbledore called over the storm of applause for even ravenclaw and hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of slytherin we need a little change of decoration he clapped his hands in an instant the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold the huge slytherin serpent vanished and a towering gryffindor lion took its place snape was 306 the man with two faces shaking professor mcgonagalls hand with a horrible forced smile he caught harrys eye and harry knew at once that snapes feelings toward him hadnt changed one jot this didnt worry harry it seemed as though life would be back to normal next year or as normal as it ever was at hogwarts it was the best evening of harrys life better than winning at quidditch or christmas or knocking out mountain trolls he would never ever forget tonight harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come but come they did to their great surprise both he and ron passed with good marks hermione of course had the best grades of the first years even neville scraped through his good herbology mark making up for his abysmal potions one they had hoped that goyle who was almost as stupid as he was mean might be thrown out but he had passed too it was a shame but as ron said you couldnt have everything in life and suddenly their wardrobes were empty their trunks were packed nevilles toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets notes were handed out to all students warning them not to use magic over the holidays i always hope theyll forget to give us these said fred weasley sadly hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake they were boarding the hogwarts express talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier eating bertie botts every flavor beans as they sped past muggle towns pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats pulling into platform nine and threequarters at kings cross station 307 chapter seventeen it took quite a while for them all to get off the platform a wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didnt attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the muggles you must come and stay this summer said ron both of you ill send you an owl thanks said harry ill need something to look forward to people jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the muggle world some of them called bye harry see you potter still famous said ron grinning at him not where im going i promise you said harry he ron and hermione passed through the gateway together there he is mom there he is look it was ginny weasley rons younger sister but she wasnt pointing at ron harry potter she squealed look mom i can see be quiet ginny and its rude to point mrs weasley smiled down at them busy year she said very said harry thanks for the fudge and the sweater mrs weasley oh it was nothing dear ready are you it was uncle vernon still purplefaced still mustached still looking furious at the nerve of harry carrying an owl in a cage in 308 the man with two faces a station full of ordinary people behind him stood aunt petunia and dudley looking terrified at the very sight of harry you must be harrys family said mrs weasley in a manner of speaking said uncle vernon hurry up boy we havent got all day he walked away harry hung back for a last word with ron and hermione see you over the summer then hope you have er a good holiday said hermione looking uncertainly after uncle vernon shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant oh i will said harry and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face they dont know were not allowed to use magic at home im going to have a lot of fun with dudley this summer 309 this book was art directed by david saylor and designed by becky terhune the art for both the jacket and interior

1989 the book was printed and bound at rr donnelley sons willard oh the production was supervised by angela biola  chapter one the worst birthday not for the first time an argument had broken out over breakfast at number four privet drive mr vernon dursley had been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud hooting noise from his nephew harrys room third time this week he roared across the table if you cant control that owl itll have to go harry tried yet again to explain shes bored he said shes used to flying around outside if i could just let her out at night do i look stupid snarled uncle vernon a bit of fried egg dangling from his bushy mustache i know whatll happen if that owls let out he exchanged dark looks with his wife petunia harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long loud belch from the dursleys son dudley i want more bacon theres more in the frying pan sweetums said aunt petunia turning misty eyes on her massive son we must build you up while weve got the chance i dont like the sound of that school food nonsense petunia i never went hungry when i was at smeltings said uncle vernon heartily dudley gets enough dont you son dudley who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the kitchen chair grinned and turned to harry pass the frying pan youve forgotten the magic word said harry irritably the effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen mrs dursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands to her mouth mr dursley jumped to his feet veins throbbing in his temples i meant please said harry quickly i didnt mean what have i told you thundered his uncle spraying spit over the table about saying the m word in our house but i how dare you threaten dudley roared uncle vernon pounding the table with his fist i just i warned you i will not tolerate mention of your abnormality under this roof harry stared from his purplefaced uncle to his pale aunt who was trying to heave dudley to his feet all right said harry all right uncle vernon sat back down breathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching harry closely out of the corners of his small sharp eyes ever since harry had come home for the summer holidays uncle vernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any moment because harry potter wasnt a normal boy as a matter of fact he was as not normal as it is possible to be harry potter was a wizard a wizard fresh from his first year at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and if the dursleys were unhappy to have him back for the holidays it was nothing to how harry felt he missed hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomachache he missed the castle with its secret passageways and ghosts his classes though perhaps not snape the potions master the mail arriving by owl eating banquets in the great hall sleeping in his fourposter bed in the tower dormitory visiting the gamekeeper hagrid in his cabin next to the forbidden forest in the grounds and especially quidditch the most popular sport in the wizarding world six tall goal posts four flying balls and fourteen players on broomsticks all harrys spellbooks his wand robes cauldron and topoftheline nimbus two thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by uncle vernon the instant harry had come home what did the dursleys care if harry lost his place on the house quidditch team because he hadnt practiced all summer what was it to the dursleys if harry went back to school without any of his homework done the dursleys were what wizards called muggles not a drop of magical blood in their veins and as far as they were concerned having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame uncle vernon had even padlocked harrys owl hedwig inside her cage to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world harry looked nothing like the rest of the family uncle vernon was large and neckless with an enormous black mustache aunt petunia was horsefaced and bony dudley was blond pink and porky harry on the other hand was small and skinny with brilliant green eyes and jetblack hair that was always untidy he wore round glasses and on his forehead was a thin lightningshaped scar it was this scar that made harry so particularly unusual even for a wizard this scar was the only hint of harrys very mysterious past of the reason he had been left on the dursleys doorstep eleven years before at the age of one year old harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest dark sorcerer of all time lord voldemort whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak harrys parents had died in voldemorts attack but harry had escaped with his lightning scar and somehow nobody understood why voldemorts powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill harry so harry had been brought up by his dead mothers sister and her husband he had spent ten years with the dursleys never understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to believing the dursleys story that he had got his scar in the car crash that had killed his parents and then exactly a year ago hogwarts had written to harry and the whole story had come out harry had taken up his place at wizard school where he and his scar were famous but now the school year was over and he was back with the dursleys for the summer back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly the dursleys hadnt even remembered that today happened to be harrys twelfth birthday of course his hopes hadnt been high theyd never given him a real present let alone a cake but to ignore it completely at that moment uncle vernon cleared his throat importantly and said now as we all know today is a very important day harry looked up hardly daring to believe it this could well be the day i make the biggest deal of my career said uncle vernon harry went back to his toast of course he thought bitterly uncle vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party hed been talking of nothing else for two weeks some rich builder and his wife were coming to dinner and uncle vernon was hoping to get a huge order from him uncle vernons company made drills i think we should run through the schedule one more time said uncle vernon we should all be in position at eight oclock petunia you will be in the lounge said aunt petunia promptly waiting to welcome them graciously to our home good good and dudley ill be waiting to open the door dudley put on a foul simpering smile may i take your coats mr and mrs mason theyll love him cried aunt petunia rapturously excellent dudley said uncle vernon then he rounded on harry and you ill be in my bedroom making no noise and pretending im not there said harry tonelessly exactly said uncle vernon nastily i will lead them into the lounge introduce you petunia and pour them drinks at eightfifteen ill announce dinner said aunt petunia and dudley youll say may i take you through to the dining room mrs mason said dudley offering his fat arm to an invisible woman my perfect little gentleman sniffed aunt petunia and you said uncle vernon viciously to harry ill be in my room making no noise and pretending im not there said harry dully precisely now we should aim to get in a few good compliments at dinner petunia any ideas vernon tells me youre a wonderful golfer mr mason do tell me where you bought your dress mrs mason perfect dudley how about we had to write an essay about our hero at school mr mason and i wrote about you this was too much for both aunt petunia and harry aunt petunia burst into tears and hugged her son while harry ducked under the table so they wouldnt see him laughing and you boy harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged ill be in my room making no noise and pretending im not there he said too right you will said uncle vernon forcefully the masons dont know anything about you and its going to stay that way when dinners over you take mrs mason back to the lounge for coffee petunia and ill bring the subject around to drills with any luck ill have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten be shopping for a vacation home in majorca this time tomorrow harry couldnt feel too excited about this he didnt think the dursleys would like him any better in majorca than they did on privet drive right im off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for dudley and me and you he snarled at harry you stay out of your aunts way while shes cleaning harry left through the back door it was a brilliant sunny day he crossed the lawn slumped down on the garden bench and sang under his breath happy birthday to me happy birthday to me no cards no presents and he would be spending the evening pretending not to exist he gazed miserably into the hedge he had never felt so lonely more than anything else at hogwarts more even than playing quidditch harry missed his best friends ron weasley and hermione granger they however didnt seem to be missing him at all neither of them had written to him all summer even though ron had said he was going to ask harry to come and stay countless times harry had been on the point of unlocking hedwigs cage by magic and sending her to ron and hermione with a letter but it wasnt worth the risk underage wizards werent allowed to use magic outside of school harry hadnt told the dursleys this he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them from locking him in the cupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick for the first couple of weeks back harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under his breath and watching dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him but the long silence from ron and hermione had made harry feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting dudley had lost its appeal and now ron and hermione had forgotten his birthday what wouldnt he give now for a message from hogwarts from any witch or wizard hed almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy draco malfoy just to be sure it hadnt all been a dream not that his whole year at hogwarts had been fun at the very end of last term harry had come facetoface with none other than lord voldemort himself voldemort might be a ruin of his former self but he was still terrifying still cunning still determined to regain power harry had slipped through voldemorts clutches for a second time but it had been a narrow escape and even now weeks later harry kept waking in the night drenched in cold sweat wondering where voldemort was now remembering his livid face his wide mad eyes harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench he had been staring absentmindedly into the hedge and the hedge was staring back two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn i know what day it is sang dudley waddling toward him the huge eyes blinked and vanished what said harry not taking his eyes off the spot where they had been i know what day it is dudley repeated coming right up to him well done said harry so youve finally learned the days of the week todays your birthday sneered dudley how come you havent got any cards havent you even got friends at that freak place better not let your mum hear you talking about my school said harry coolly dudley hitched up his trousers which were slipping down his fat bottom whyre you staring at the hedge he said suspiciously im trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire said harry dudley stumbled backward at once a look of panic on his fat face you ccant dad told you youre not to do mmagic he said hell chuck you out of the house and you havent got anywhere else to go you havent got any friends to take you jiggery pokery said harry in a fierce voice hocus pocus squiggly wiggly muuuuuum howled dudley tripping over his feet as he dashed back toward the house muuuum hes doing you know what harry paid dearly for his moment of fun as neither dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt aunt petunia knew he hadnt really done magic but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan then she gave him work to do with the promise he wouldnt eat again until hed finished while dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream harry cleaned the windows washed the car mowed the lawn trimmed the flowerbeds pruned and watered the roses and repainted the garden bench the sun blazed overhead burning the back of his neck harry knew he shouldnt have risen to dudleys bait but dudley had said the very thing harry had been thinking himself maybe he didnt have any friends at hogwarts wish they could see famous harry potter now he thought savagely as he spread manure on the flower beds his back aching sweat running down his face it was half past seven in the evening when at last exhausted he heard aunt petunia calling him get in here and walk on the newspaper harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen on top of the fridge stood tonights pudding a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets a loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven eat quickly the masons will be here soon snapped aunt petunia pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table she was already wearing a salmonpink cocktail dress harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper the moment he had finished aunt petunia whisked away his plate upstairs hurry as he passed the door to the living room harry caught a glimpse of uncle vernon and dudley in bow ties and dinner jackets he had only just reached the upstairs landing when the door bell rang and uncle vernons furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs remember boy one sound harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe slipped inside closed the door and turned to collapse on his bed the trouble was there was already someone sitting on it chapter two dobbys warning harry managed not to shout out but it was a close thing the little creature on the bed had large batlike ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls harry knew instantly that this was what had been watching him out of the garden hedge that morning as they stared at each other harry heard dudleys voice from the hall may i take your coats mr and mrs mason the creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long thin nose touched the carpet harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase with rips for arm and legholes er hello said harry nervously harry potter said the creature in a highpitched voice harry was sure would carry down the stairs so long has dobby wanted to meet you sir such an honor it is ththank you said harry edging along the wall and sinking into his desk chair next to hedwig who was asleep in her large cage he wanted to ask what are you but thought it would sound too rude so instead he said who are you dobby sir just dobby dobby the houseelf said the creature oh really said harry er i dont want to be rude or anything but this isnt a great time for me to have a houseelf in my bedroom aunt petunias high false laugh sounded from the living room the elf hung his head not that im not pleased to meet you said harry quickly but er is there any particular reason youre here oh yes sir said dobby earnestly dobby has come to tell you sir it is difficult sir dobby wonders where to begin sit down said harry politely pointing at the bed to his horror the elf burst into tears very noisy tears ssit down he wailed never never ever harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter im sorry he whispered i didnt mean to offend you or anything offend dobby choked the elf dobby has never been asked to sit down by a wizard like an equal harry trying to say shh and look comforting at the same time ushered dobby back onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing looking like a large and very ugly doll at last he managed to control himself and sat with his great eyes fixed on harry in an expression of watery adoration you cant have met many decent wizards said harry trying to cheer him up dobby shook his head then without warning he leapt up and started banging his head furiously on the window shouting bad dobby bad dobby dont what are you doing harry hissed springing up and pulling dobby back onto the bed hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage dobby had to punish himself sir said the elf who had gone slightly crosseyed dobby almost spoke ill of his family sir your family the wizard family dobby serves sir dobby is a houself bound to serve one house and one family forever do they know youre here asked harry curiously dobby shuddered oh no sir no dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for coming to see you sir dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this if they ever knew sir but wont they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door dobby doubts it sir dobby is always having to punish himself for something sir they lets dobby get on with it sir sometimes they reminds me to do extra punishments but why dont you leave escape a houseelf must be set free sir and the family will never set dobby free dobby will serve the family until he dies sir harry stared and i thought i had it bad staying here for another four weeks he said this makes the dursleys sound almost human cant anyone help you cant i almost at once harry wished he hadnt spoken dobby dissolved again into wails of gratitude please harry whispered frantically please be quiet if the dursleys hear anything if they know youre here harry potter asks if he can help dobby dobby has heard of your greatness sir but of your goodness dobby never knew harry who was feeling distinctly hot in the face said whatever youve heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish im not even top of my year at hogwarts thats hermione she but he stopped quickly because thinking about hermione was painful iharry potter is humble and modest said dobby reverently his orblike eyes aglow harry potter speaks not of his triumph over hewhomustnotbe named voldemort said harry dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned ah speak not the name sir speak not the name sorry said harry quickly i know lots of people dont like it my friend ron he stopped again thinking about ron was painful too dobby leaned toward harry his eyes wide as headlights dobby heard tell he said hoarsely that harry potter met the dark lord for a second time just weeks ago that harry potter escaped yet again harry nodded and dobbys eyes suddenly shone with tears ah sir he gasped dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby pillowcase he was wearing harry potter is valiant and bold he has braved so many dangers already but dobby has come to protect harry potter to warn him even if he does have to shut his ears in the oven door later harry potter must not go back to hogwarts there was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from downstairs and the distant rumble of uncle vernons voice wwhat harry stammered but ive got to go back term starts on september first its all thats keeping me going you dont know what its like here i dont belong here i belong in your world at hogwarts no no no squeaked dobby shaking his head so hard his ears flapped harry potter must stay where he is safe he is too great too good to lose if harry potter goes back to hogwarts he will be in mortal danger why said harry in surprise there is a plot harry potter a plot to make most terrible things happen at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry this year whispered dobby suddenly trembling all over dobby has known it for months sir harry potter must not put himself in peril he is too important sir what terrible things said harry at once whos plotting them dobby made a funny choking noise and then banged his head frantically against the wall all right cried harry grabbing the elfs arm to stop him you cant tell me i understand but why are you warning me a sudden unpleasant thought struck him hang on this hasnt got anything to do with vol sorry with you knowwho has it you could just shake or nod he added hastily as dobbys head tilted worryingly close to the wall again slowly dobby shook his head not not he whomustnotbenamed sir but dobbys eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give harry a hint harry however was completely lost he hasnt got a brother has he dobby shook his head his eyes wider than ever well then i cant think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at hogwarts said harry i mean theres dumbledore for one thing you know who dumbledore is dont you dobby bowed his head albus dumbledore is the greatest headmaster hogwarts has ever had dobby knows it sir dobby has heard dumbledores powers rival those of he whomustnotbenamed at the height of his strength but sir dobbys voice dropped to an urgent whisper there are powers dumbledore doesnt powers no decent wizard and before harry could stop him dobby bounded off the bed seized harrys desk lamp and started beating himself around the head with earsplitting yelps a sudden silence fell downstairs two seconds later harry heart thudding madly heard uncle vernon coming into the hall calling dudley must have left his television on again the little tyke quick in the closet hissed harry stuffing dobby in shutting the door and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned what the devil are you doing said uncle vernon through gritted teeth his face horribly close to harrys youve just ruined the punch line of my japanese golfer joke one more sound and youll wish youd never been born boy he stomped flatfooted from the room shaking harry let dobby out of the closet see what its like here he said see why ive got to go back to hogwarts its the only place ive got well i think ive got friends friends who dont even write to harry potter said dobby slyly i expect theyve just been wait a minute said harry frowning how do you know my friends havent been writing to me dobby shuffled his feet harry potter mustnt be angry with dobby dobby did it for the best have you been stopping my letters dobby has them here sir said the elf stepping nimbly out of harrys reach he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase he was wearing harry could make out hermiones neat writing rons untidy scrawl and even a scribble that looked as though it was from the hogwarts gamekeeper hagrid dobby blinked anxiously up at harry harry potter mustnt be angry dobby hoped if harry potter thought his friends had forgotten him harry potter might not want to go back to school sir harry wasnt listening he made a grab for the letters but dobby jumped out of reach harry potter will have them sir if he gives dobby his word that he will not return to hogwarts ah sir this is a danger you must not face say you wont go back sir no said harry angrily give me my friends letters then harry potter leaves dobby no choice said the elf sadly before harry could move dobby had darted to the bedroom door pulled it open and sprinted down the stairs mouth dry stomach lurching harry sprang after him trying not to make a sound he jumped the last six steps landing catlike on the hall carpet looking around for dobby from the dining room he heard uncle vernon saying tell petunia that very funny story about those american plumbers mr mason shes been dying to hear harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear aunt petunias masterpiece of a pudding the mountain of cream and sugared violets was floating up near the ceiling on top of a cupboard in the corner crouched dobby no croaked harry please theyll kill me harry potter must say hes not going back to school dobby please say it sir i cant dobby gave him a tragic look then dobby must do it sir for harry potters own good the pudding fell to the floor with a heartstopping crash cream splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered with a crack like a whip dobby vanished there were screams from the dining room and uncle vernon burst into the kitchen to find harry rigid with shock covered from head to foot in aunt petunias pudding at first it looked as though uncle vernon would manage to gloss the whole thing over just our nephew very disturbed meeting strangers upsets him so we kept him upstairs he shooed the shocked masons back into the dining room promised harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the masons had left and handed him a mop aunt petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer and harry still shaking started scrubbing the kitchen clean uncle vernon might still have been able to make his deal if it hadnt been for the owl aunt petunia was just passing around a box of afterdinner mints when a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window dropped a letter on mrs masons head and swooped out again mrs mason screamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting about lunatics mr mason stayed just long enough to tell the dursleys that his wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes and to ask whether this was their idea of a joke harry stood in the kitchen clutching the mop for support as uncle vernon advanced on him a demonic glint in his tiny eyes read it he hissed evilly brandishing the letter the owl had delivered go on read it harry took it it did not contain birthday greetings dear mr potter we have received intelligence that a hover charm was used at your place of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine as you know underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells outside school and further spellwork on your part may lead to expulsion from said school decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery 1875 paragraph c we would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that risks notice by members of the nonmagical community muggles is a serious offense under section 13 of the international confederation of warlocks statute of secrecy enjoy your holidays yours sincerely mafalda hopkirk improper use of magic office ministry of magic harry looked up from the letter and gulped you didnt tell us you werent allowed to use magic outside school said uncle vernon a mad gleam dancing in his eyes for got to mention it slipped your mind i daresay he was bearing down on harry like a great bulldog all his teeth bared well ive got news for you boy im locking you up youre never going back to that school never and if you try and magic yourself out theyll expel you and laughing like a maniac he dragged harry back upstairs uncle vernon was as bad as his word the following morning he paid a man to fit bars on harrys window he himself fitted a catflap in the bedroom door so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day they let harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening otherwise he was locked in his room around the clock three days later the dursleys were showing no sign of relenting and harry couldnt see any way out of his situation he lay on his bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably what was going to happen to him what was the good of magicking himself out of his room if hogwarts would expel him for doing it yet life at privet drive had reached an alltime low now that the dursleys knew they werent going to wake up as fruit bats he had lost his only weapon dobby might have saved harry from horrible happenings at hogwarts but the way things were going hed probably starve to death anyway the catflap rattled and aunt petunias hand appeared pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room harry whose insides were aching with hunger jumped off his bed and seized it the soup was stonecold but he drank half of it in one gulp then he crossed the room to hedwigs cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray she ruffled her feathers and gave him a look of deep disgust its no good turning your beak up at it thats all weve got said harry grimly he put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the catflap and lay back down on the bed somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup supposing he was still alive in another four weeks what would happen if he didnt turn up at hogwarts would someone be sent to see why he hadnt come back would they be able to make the dursleys let him go the room was growing dark exhausted stomach rumbling mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions harry fell into an uneasy sleep he dreamed that he was on show in a zoo with a card reading underage wizard attached to his cage people goggled through the bars at him as he lay starving and weak on a bed of straw he saw dobbys face in the crowd and shouted out asking for help but dobby called harry potter is safe there sir and vanished then the dursleys appeared and dudley rattled the bars of the cage laughing at him stop it harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head leave me alone cut it out im trying to sleep he opened his eyes moonlight was shining through the bars on the window and someone was goggling through the bars at him a frecklefaced red haired longnosed someone ron weasley was outside harrys window chapter three the burrow ron breathed harry creeping to the window and pushing it up so they could talk through the bars ron how did you what the harrys mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hit him ron was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car which was parked in midair grinning at harry from the front seats were fred and george rons elder twin brothers all right harry asked george whats been going on said ron why havent you been answering my letters ive asked you to stay about twelve times and then dad came home and said youd got an official warning for using magic in front of muggles it wasnt me and how did he know he works for the ministry said ron you know were not supposed to do spells outside school you should talk said harry staring at the floating car oh this doesnt count said ron were only borrowing this its dads we didnt enchant it but doing magic in front of those muggles you live with i told you i didnt but itll take too long to explain now look can you tell them at hogwarts that the dursleys have locked me up and wont let me come back and obviously i cant magic myself out because the ministryil think thats the second spell ive done in three days so stop gibbering said ron weve come to take you home with us but you cant magic me out either we dont need to said ron jerking his head toward the front seat and grinning you forget who ive got with me tie that around the bars said fred throwing the end of a rope to harry if the dursleys wake up im dead said harry as he tied the rope tightly around a bar and fred revved up the car dont worry said fred and stand back harry moved back into the shadows next to hedwig who seemed to have realized how important this was and kept still and silent the car revved louder and louder and suddenly with a crunching noise the bars were pulled clean out of the window as fred drove straight up in the air harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground panting ron hoisted them up into the car harry listened anxiously but there was no sound from the dursleys bedroom when the bars were safely in the back seat with ron fred reversed as close as possible to harrys window get in ron said but all my hogwarts stuff my wand my broomstick where is it locked in the cupboard under the stairs and i cant get out of this room no problem said george from the front passenger seat out of the way harry fred and george climbed catlike through the window into harrys room you had to hand it to them thought harry as george took an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock a lot of wizards think its a waste of time knowing this sort of muggle trick said fred but we feel theyre skills worth learning even if they are a bit slow there was a small click and the door swung open so well get your trunk you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to ron whispered george watch out for the bottom stair it creaks harry whispered back as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing harry dashed around his room collecting his things and passing them out of the window to ron then he went to help fred and george heave his trunk up the stairs harry heard uncle vernon cough at last panting they reached the landing then carried the trunk through harrys room to the open window fred climbed back into the car to pull with ron and harry and george pushed from the bedroom side inch by inch the trunk slid through the window uncle vernon coughed again a bit more panted fred who was pulling from inside the car one good push harry and george threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car okay lets go george whispered but as harry climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud screech from behind him followed immediately by the thunder of uncle vernons voice that ruddy owl ive forgotten hedwig harry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on he snatched up hedwigs cage dashed to the window and passed it out to ron he was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when uncle vernon hammered on the unlocked door and it crashed open for a split second uncle vernon stood framed in the doorway then he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at harry grabbing him by the ankle ron fred and george seized harrys arms and pulled as hard as they could petunia roared uncle vernon hes getting away hes getting away but the weasleys gave a gigantic tug and harrys leg slid out of uncle vernons grasp harry was in the car hed slammed the door shut put your foot down fred yelled ron and the car shot suddenly toward the moon harry couldnt believe it he was free he rolled down the window the night air whipping his hair and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of privet drive uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley were all hanging dumbstruck out of harrys window see you next summer harry yelled the weasleys roared with laughter and harry settled back in his seat grinning from ear to ear let hedwig out he told ron she can fly behind us she hasnt had a chance to stretch her wings for ages george handed the hairpin to ron and a moment later hedwig soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost so whats the story harry said ron impatiently whats been happening harry told them all about dobby the warning hed given harry and the fiasco of the violet pudding there was a long shocked silence when he had finished very fishy said fred finally definitely dodgy agreed george so he wouldnt even tell you whos supposed to be plotting all this stuff i dont think he could said harry i told you every time he got close to letting something slip he started banging his head against the wall he saw fred and george look at each other what you think he was lying to me said harry well said fred put it this way houseelves have got powerful magic of their own but they cant usually use it without their masters permission i reckon old dobby was sent to stop you coming back to hogwarts someones idea of a joke can you think of anyone at school with a grudge against you yes said harry and ron together instantly draco malfoy harry explained he hates me draco malfoy said george turning around not lucius malfoys son must be its not a very common name is it said harry ive heard dad talking about him said george he was a big supporter of youknowwho and when youknowwho disappeared said fred craning around to look at harry lucius malfoy came back saying hed never meant any of it load of dung dad reckons he was right in youknowwhos inner circle harry had heard these rumors about malfoys family before and they didnt surprise him at all malfoy made dudley dursley look like a kind thoughtful and sensitive boy i dont know whether the malfoys own a houseelfsaid harry well whoever owns him will be an old wizarding family and theyll be rich said fred yeah mums always wishing we had a houseelf to do the ironingsaid george but all weve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden houseelves come with big old manors and castles and places like that you wouldnt catch one in our house harry was silent judging by the fact that draco malfoy usually had the best of everything his family was rolling in wizard gold he could just see malfoy strutting around a large manor house sending the family servant to stop harry from going back to hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing malfoy would do had harry been stupid to take dobby seriously im glad we came to get you anyway said ron i was getting really worried when you didnt answer any of my letters i thought it was errols fault at first whos errol our owl hes ancient it wouldnt be the first time hed collapsed on a delivery so then i tried to borrow hermes who the owl mum and dad bought percy when he was made prefect said fred from the front but percy wouldnt lend him to me said ron said he needed him percys been acting very oddly this summer said george frowning and he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a load of time shut up in his room i mean theres only so many times you can polish a prefect badge youre driving too far west fred he added pointing at a compass on the dashboard fred twiddled the steering wheel so does your dad know youve got the car said harry guessing the answer er no said ron he had to work tonight hopefully well be able to get it back in the garage without mum noticing we flew it what does your dad do at the ministry of magic anyway he works in the most boring department said ron the misuse of muggle artifacts office the what its all to do with bewitching things that are mugglemade you know in case they end up back in a muggle shop or house like last year some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop this muggle woman bought it took it home and tried to serve her friends tea in it it was a nightmare dad was working overtime for weeks what happened the teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose dad was going frantic its only him and an old warlock called perkins in the office and they had to do memory charms and all sorts of stuff to cover it up but your dad this car fred laughed yeah dads crazy about everything to do with muggles our sheds full of muggle stuff he takes it apart puts spells on it and puts it back together again if he raided our house hed have to put himself under arrest it drives mum mad thats the main road said george peering down through the windshield well be there in ten minutes just as well its getting light a faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east fred brought the car lower and harry saw a dark patchwork of fields and clumps of trees were a little way outside the village said george ottery st catchpole lower and lower went the flying car the edge of a brilliant red sun was now gleaming through the trees touchdown said fred as with a slight bump they hit the ground they had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard and harry looked out for the first time at rons house it looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen but extra rooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic which harry reminded himself it probably was four or five chimneys were perched on top of the red roof a lopsided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance read the burrow around the front door lay a jumble of rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron several fat brown chickens were pecking their way around the yard its not much said ron its wonderful said harry happily thinking of privet drive they got out of the car now well go upstairs really quietly said fred and wait for mum to call us for breakfast then ron you come bounding downstairs going mum look who turned up in the night and shell be all pleased to see harry and no one need ever know we flew the car right said ron come on harry i sleep at the at the top ron had gone a nasty greenish color his eyes fixed on the house the other three wheeled around mrs weasley was marching across the yard scattering chickens and for a short plump kindfaced woman it was remarkable how much she looked like a sabertoothed tiger ah said fred oh dear said george mrs weasley came to a halt in front of them her hands on her hips staring from one guilty face to the next she was wearing a flowered apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket so she said morning mum said george in what he clearly thought was a jaunty winning voice have you any idea how worried ive been said mrs weasley in a deadly whisper sorry mum but see we had to all three of mrs weasleys sons were taller than she was but they cowered as her rage broke over them beds empty no note car gone could have crashed out of my mind with worry did you care never as long as ive lived you wait until your father gets home we never had trouble like this from bill or charlie or percy perfect percy muttered fred you could do with taking a leaf out of percys book yelled mrs weasley prodding a finger in freds chest you could have died you could have been seen you could have lost your father his job it seemed to go on for hours mrs weasley had shouted herself hoarse before she turned on harry who backed away im very pleased to see you harry dear she said come in and have some breakfast she turned and walked back into the house and harry after a nervous glance at ron who nodded encouragingly followed her the kitchen was small and rather cramped there was a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle and harry sat down on the edge of his seat looking around he had never been in a wizard house before the clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers at all written around the edge were things like time to make tea time to feed the chickens and youre late books were stacked three deep on the mantelpiece books with titles like charm your own cheese enchantment in baking and one minute feasts its magic and unless harrys ears were deceiving him the old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was witching hour with the popular singing sorceress celestina warbeck mrs weasley was clattering around cooking breakfast a little haphazardly throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages into the frying pan every now and then she muttered things like dont know what you were thinking of and never would have believed it i dont blame you dear she assured harry tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate arthur and i have been worried about you too just last night we were saying wed come and get you ourselves if you hadnt written back to ron by friday but really she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate flying an illegal car halfway across the country anyone could have seen you she flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink which began to clean themselves clinking gently in the background it was cloudy mum said fred you keep your mouth closed while youre eating mrs weasley snapped they were starving him mum said george and you said mrs weasley but it was with a slightly softened expression that she started cutting harry bread and buttering it for him at that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small redheaded figure in a long nightdress who appeared in the kitchen gave a small squeal and ran out again ginny said ron in an undertone to harry my sister shes been talking about you all summer yeah shell be wanting your autograph harry fred said with a grin but he caught his mothers eye and bent his face over his plate without another word nothing more was said until all four plates were clean which took a surprisingly short time blimey im tired yawned fred setting down his knife and fork at last i think ill go to bed and you will not snapped mrs weasley its your own fault youve been up all night youre going to degnome the garden for me theyre getting completely out of hand again oh mum and you two she said glaring at ron and fred you can go up to bed dear she added to harry you didnt ask them to fly that wretched car but harry who felt wide awake said quickly ill help ron ive never seen a degnoming thats very sweet of you dear but its dull work said mrs weasley now lets see what lockharts got to say on the subject and she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece george groaned mum we know how to degnome a garden harry looked at the cover of mrs weasleys book written across it in fancy gold letters were the words gilderoy lockharts guide to household pests there was a big photograph on the front of a very goodlooking wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes as always in the wizarding world the photograph was moving the wizard who harry supposed was gilderoy lockhart kept winking cheekily up at them all mrs weasley beamed down at him oh he is marvelous she said he knows his household pests all right its a wonderful book mum fancies him said fred in a very audible whisper dont be so ridiculous fred said mrs weasley her cheeks rather pink all right if you think you know better than lockhart you can go and get on with it and woe betide you if theres a single gnome in that garden when i come out to inspect it yawning and grumbling the weasleys slouched outside with harry behind them the garden was large and in harrys eyes exactly what a garden should be the dursleys wouldnt have liked it there were plenty of weeds and the grass needed cutting but there were gnarled trees all around the walls plants harry had never seen spilling from every flower bed and a big green pond full of frogs muggles have garden gnomes too you know harry told ron they crossed the lawn yeah ive seen those things they think are gnomes said ron bent double with his head in a peony bush like fat little santa clauses with fishing rods there was a violent scuffling noise the peony bush shuddered and ron straightened up this is a gnome he said grimly gerroff me gerroff me squealed the gnome it was certainly nothing like santa claus it was small and leathery looking with a large knobby bald head exactly like a potato ron held it at arms length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down this is what you have to do he said he raised the gnome above his head gerroff me and started to swing it in great circles like a lasso seeing the shocked look on harrys face ron added it doesnt hurt them youve just got to make them really dizzy so they cant find their way back to the gnomeholes he let go of the gnomes ankles it flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge pitiful said fred i bet i can get mine beyond that stump harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes he decided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge but the gnome sensing weakness sank its razorsharp teeth into harrys finger and he had a hard job shaking it off until wow harry that mustve been fifty feet the air was soon thick with flying gnomes see theyre not too bright said george seizing five or six gnomes at once the moment they know the degnomings going on they storm up to have a look youd think theyd have learned by now just to stay put soon the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line their little shoulders hunched theyll be back said ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field they love it here dads too soft with them he thinks theyre funny just then the front door slammed hes back said george dads home they hurried through the garden and back into the house mr weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and his eyes closed he was a thin man going bald but the little hair he had was as red as any of his childrens he was wearing long green robes which were dusty and travelworn what a night he mumbled groping for the teapot as they all sat down around him nine raids nine and old mundungus fletcher tried to put a hex on me when i had my back turned mr weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed find anything dad said fred eagerly all i got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle yawned mr weasley there was some pretty nasty stuff that wasnt my department though mortlake was taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets but thats the committee on experimental charms thank goodness why would anyone bother making door keys shrink said george just mugglebaiting sighed mr weasley sell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it of course its very hard to convict anyone because no muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking theyll insist they just keep losing it bless them theyll go to any lengths to ignore magic even if its staring them in the face but the things our lot have taken to enchanting you wouldnt believe like cars for instance mrs weasley had appeared holding a long poker like a sword mr weasleys eyes jerked open he stared guiltily at his wife ccars molly dear yes arthur cars said mrs weasley her eyes flashing imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked while really he was enchanting it to make it fly mr weasley blinked well dear i think youll find that he would be quite within the law to do that even if er he maybe would have done better to um tell his wife the truth theres a loophole in the law youll find as long as he wasnt intending to fly the car the fact that the car could fly wouldnt arthur weasley you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law shouted mrs weasley just so you could carry on tinkering with all that muggle rubbish in your shed and for your information harry arrived this morning in the car you werent intending to fly harry said mr weasley blankly harry who he looked around saw harry and jumped good lord is it harry potter very pleased to meet you rons told us so much about your sons flew that car to harrys house and back last night shouted mrs weasley what have you got to say about that eh did you really said mr weasley eagerly did it go all right i i mean he faltered as sparks flew from mrs weasleys eyes that that was very wrong boys very wrong indeed lets leave them to it ron muttered to harry as mrs weasley swelled like a bullfrog come on ill show you my bedroom they slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase which wound its way zigzagging up through the house on the third landing a door stood ajar harry just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with a snap ginny said ron you dont know how weird it is for her to be this shy she never shuts up normally they climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling paint and a small plaque on it saying ronalds room harry stepped in his head almost touching the sloping ceiling and blinked it was like walking into a furnace nearly everything in rons room seemed to be a violent shade of orange the bedspread the walls even the ceiling then harry realized that ron had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards all wearing bright orange robes carrying broomsticks and waving energetically your quidditch team said harry the chudley cannons said ron pointing at the orange bedspread which was emblazoned with two giant black cs and a speeding cannonball ninth in the league rons school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner next to a pile of comics that all seemed to feature the adventures of martin miggs the mad muggle rons magic wand was lying on top of a fish tank full of frog spawn on the windowsill next to his fat gray rat scabbers who was snoozing in a patch of sun harry stepped over a pack of selfshuffling playing cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window in the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the weasleys hedge then he turned to look at ron who was watching him almost nervously as though waiting for his opinion its a bit small said ron quickly not like that room you had with the muggles and im right underneath the ghoul in the attic hes always banging on the pipes and groaning but harry grinning widely said this is the best house ive ever been in rons ears went pink chapter four at florish and blotts life at the burrow was as different as possible from life on privet drive the dursleys liked everything neat and ordered the weasleys house burst with the strange and unexpected harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted tuck your shirt in scruffy the ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet and small explosions from fred and georges bedroom were considered perfectly normal what harry found most unusual about life at rons however wasnt the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul it was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him mrs weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat fourth helpings at every meal mr weasley liked harry to sit next to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with muggles asking him to explain how things like plugs and the postal service worked fascinating he would say as harry talked him through using a telephone ingenious really how many ways muggles have found of getting along without magic harry heard from hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he had arrived at the burrow he and ron went down to breakfast to find mr and mrs weasley and ginny already sitting at the kitchen table the moment she saw harry ginny accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter ginny seemed very prone to knocking things over whenever harry entered a room she dived under the table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing like the setting sun pretending he hadnt noticed this harry sat down and took the toast mrs weasley offered him letters from school said mr weasley passing harry and ron identical envelopes of yellowish parchment addressed in green ink dumbledore already knows youre here harry doesnt miss a trick that man you twove got them too he added as fred and george ambled in still in their pajamas for a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters harrys told him to catch the hogwarts express as usual from kings cross station on september first there was also a list of the new books hed need for the coming year secondyear students will require the standard book of spells grade 2 by miranda goshawk break with a banshee by gilderoy lockhart gadding with ghouls by gilderoy lockhart holidays with hags by gilderoy lockhart travels with trolls by gilderoy lockhart voyages with vampires by gilderoy lockhart wanderings with werewolves by gilderoy lockhart year with the yeti by gilderoy lockhart fred who had finished his own list peered over at harrys youve been told to get all lockharts books too he said the new defense against the dark arts teacher must be a fan bet its a witch at this point fred caught his mothers eye and quickly busied himself with the marmalade that lot wont come cheap said george with a quick look at his parents lockharts books are really expensive well well manage said mrs weasley but she looked worried i expect well be able to pick up a lot of ginnys things secondhand oh are you starting at hogwarts this year harry asked ginny she nodded blushing to the roots of her flaming hair and put her elbow in the butter dish fortunately no one saw this except harry because just then rons elder brother percy walked in he was already dressed his hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his sweater morning all said percy briskly lovely day he sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almost immediately pulling from underneath him a moulting gray feather duster at least that was what harry thought it was until he saw that it was breathing errol said ron taking the limp owl from percy and extracting a letter from under its wing finally hes got hermiones answer i wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the dursleys he carried errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to stand him on it but errol flopped straight off again so ron lay him on the draining board instead muttering pathetic then he ripped open hermiones letter and read it out loud dear ron and harry if youre there i hope everything went all right and that harry is okay and that you didnt do anything illegal to get him out ron because that would get harry into trouble too ive been really worried and if harry is all right will you please let me know at once but perhaps it would be bet ter if you used a different owl because i think another delivery might finish your one off im very busy with schoolwork of course how can she be said ron in horror were on vacation and were going to london next wednesday to buy my new books why dont we meet in diagon alley let me know whats happening as soon as you can love from hermione well that fits in nicely we can go and get all your things then too said mrs weasley starting to clear the table whatre you all up to today harry ron fred and george were planning to go up the hill to a small paddock the weasleys owned it was surrounded by trees that blocked it from view of the village below meaning that they could practice quidditch there as long as they didnt fly too high they couldnt use real quidditch balls which would have been hard to explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village instead they threw apples for one another to catch they took turns riding harrys nimbus two thousand which was easily the best broom rons old shooting star was often outstripped by passing butterflies five minutes later they were marching up the hill broomsticks over their shoulders they had asked percy if he wanted to join them but he had said he was busy harry had only seen percy at mealtimes so far he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time wish i knew what he was up to said fred frowning hes not himself his exam results came the day before you did twelve owls and he hardly gloated at all ordinary wizarding levels george explained seeing harrys puzzled look bill got twelve too if were not careful well have another head boy in the family i dont think i could stand the shame bill was the oldest weasley brother he and the next brother charlie had already left hogwarts harry had never met either of them but knew that charlie was in romania studying dragons and bill in egypt working for the wizards bank gringotts dunno how mum and dad are going to afford all our school stuff this year said george after a while five sets of lockhart books and ginny needs robes and a wand and everything harry said nothing he felt a bit awkward stored in an underground vault at gringotts in london was a small fortune that his parents had left him of course it was only in the wizarding world that he had money you couldnt use galleons sickles and knuts in muggle shops he had never mentioned his gringotts bank account to the dursleys he didnt think their horror of anything connected with magic would stretch to a large pile of gold mrs weasley woke them all early the following wednesday after a quick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each they pulled on their coats and mrs weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and peered inside were running low arthur she sighed well have to buy some more today ah well guests first after you harry dear and she offered him the flowerpot harry stared at them all watching him wwhat am i supposed to do he stammered hes never traveled by floo powder said ron suddenly sorry harry i forgot never said mr weasley but how did you get to diagon alley to buy your school things last year i went on the underground really said mr weasley eagerly were there escapators how exactly not now arthur said mrs weasley floo powders a lot quicker dear but goodness me if youve never used it before hell be all right mum said fred harry watch us first he took a pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot stepped up to the fire and threw the powder into the flames with a roar the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than fred who stepped right into it shouted diagon alley and vanished you must speak clearly dear mrs weasley told harry as george dipped his hand into the flowerpot and be sure to get out at the right grate the right what said harry nervously as the fire roared and whipped george out of sight too well there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from you know but as long as youve spoken clearly hell be fine molly dont fuss said mr weasley helping himself to floo powder too but dear if he got lost how would we ever explain to his aunt and uncle they wouldnt mind harry reassured her dudley would think it was a brilliant joke if i got lost up a chimney dont worry about that well all right you go after arthur said mrs weasley now when you get into the fire say where youre going and keep your elbows tucked in ron advised and your eyes shut said mrs weasley the soot dont fidget said ron or you might well fall out of the wrong fireplace but dont panic and get out too early wait until you see fred and george trying hard to bear all this in mind harry took a pinch of floo powder and walked to the edge of the fire he took a deep breath scattered the powder into the flames and stepped forward the fire felt like a warm breeze he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot of hot ash ddiagon alley he coughed it felt as though he was being sucked down a giant drain he seemed to be spinning very fast the roaring in his ears was deafening he tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel sick something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in tightly still spinning and spinning now it felt as though cold hands were slapping his face squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond his bacon sandwiches were churning inside him he closed his eyes again wishing it would stop and then he fell face forward onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses snap dizzy and bruised covered in soot he got gingerly to his feet holding his broken glasses up to his eyes he was cite alone but where he was he had no idea all he could tell was that he was standing in the stone fireplace of what looked like a large dimly lit wizards shop but nothing in here was ever likely to be on a hogwarts school list a glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion a bloodstained pack of cards and a staring glass eye evillooking masks stared down from the walls an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter and rusty spiked instruments hung from the ceiling even worse the dark narrow street harry could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not diagon alley the sooner he got out of here the better nose still stinging where it had hit the hearth harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door but before hed got halfway toward it two people appeared on the other side of the glass and one of them was the very last person harry wanted to meet when he was lost covered in soot and wearing broken glasses draco malfoy harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed leaving a small crack to peer through seconds later a bell clanged and malfoy stepped into the shop the man who followed could only be dracos father he had the same pale pointed face and identical cold gray eyes mr malfoy crossed the shop looking lazily at the items on display and rang a bell on the counter before turning to his son and saying touch nothing draco malfoy who had reached for the glass eye said i thought you were going to buy me a present i said i would buy you a racing broom said his father drumming his fingers on the counter whats the good of that if im not on the house team said malfoy looking sulky and badtempered harry potter got a nimbus two thousand last year special permission from dumbledore so he could play for gryffindor hes not even that good its just because hes famous famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead malfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls everyone thinks hes so smart wonderful potter with his scar and his broomstick you have told me this at least a dozen times already said mr malfoy with a quelling look at his son and i would remind you that it is not prudent to appear less than fond of harry potter not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the dark lord disappear ah mr borgin a stooping man had appeared behind the counter smoothing his greasy hair back from his face mr malfoy what a pleasure to see you again said mr borgin in a voice as oily as his hair delighted and young master malfoy too charmed how may i be of assistance i must show you just in today and very reasonably priced im not buying today mr borgin but selling said mr malfoy selling the smile faded slightly from mr borgins face you have heard of course that the ministry is conducting more raids said mr malfoy taking a roll of parchment from his inside pocket and unraveling it for mr borgin to read i have a few ah items at home that might embarrass me if the ministry were to call mr borgin fixed a pair of pincenez to his nose and looked down the list the ministry wouldnt presume to trouble you sir surely mr malfoys lip curled i have not been visited yet the name malfoy still commands a certain respect yet the ministry grows ever more meddlesome there are rumors about a new muggle protection act no doubt that fleabitten muggle loving fool arthur weasley is behind it harry felt a hot surge of anger and as you see certain of these poisons might make it appear i understand sir of course said mr borgin let me see can i have that interrupted draco pointing at the withered hand on its cushion ah the hand of glory said mr borgin abandoning mr malfoys list and scurrying over to draco insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder best friend of thieves and plunderers your son has fine taste sir i hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer borgin said mr malfoy coldly and mr borgin said quickly no offense sir no offense meant though if his grades dont pick up said mr malfoy more coldly still that may indeed be all he is fit for its not my fault retorted draco the teachers all have favorites that hermione granger i would have thought youd be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam snapped mr malfoy ha said harry under his breath pleased to see draco looking both abashed and angry its the same all over said mr borgin in his oily voice wizard blood is counting for less everywhere not with me said mr malfoy his long nostrils flaring no sir nor with me sir said mr borgin with a deep bow in that case perhaps we can return to my list said mr malfoy shortly i am in something of a hurry borgin i have important business elsewhere today they started to haggle harry watched nervously as draco drew nearer and nearer to his hiding place examining the objects for sale draco paused to examine a long coil of hangmans rope and to read smirking the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals caution do not touch cursed has claimed the lives of nineteen muggle owners to date draco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him he walked forward he stretched out his hand for the handle done said mr malfoy at the counter come draco harry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as draco turned away good day to you mr borgin ill expect you at the manor tomorrow to pick up the goods the moment the door had closed mr borgin dropped his oily manner good day yourself mister malfoy and if the stories are true you havent sold me half of whats hidden in your manor muttering darkly mr borgin disappeared into a back room harry waited for a minute in case he came back then quietly as he could slipped out of the cabinet past the glass cases and out of the shop door clutching his broken glasses to his face harry stared around he had emerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the dark arts the one hed just left borgin and burkes looked like the largest but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads and two doors down a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders two shabbylooking wizards were watching him from the shadow of a doorway muttering to each other feeling jumpy harry set off trying to hold his glasses on straight and hoping against hope hed be able to find a way out of here an old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous candles told him he was in knockturn alley this didnt help as harry had never heard of such a place he supposed he hadnt spoken clearly enough through his mouthful of ashes back in the weasleys fire trying to stay calm he wondered what to do not lost are you my dear said a voice in his ear making him jump an aged witch stood in front of him holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails she leered at him showing mossy teeth harry backed away im fine thanks he said im just harry what dyeh think yer doin down there harrys heart leapt so did the witch a load of fingernails cascaded down over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper came striding toward them beetleblack eyes flashing over his great bristling beard hagrid harry croaked in relief i was lost floo powder hagrid seized harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away from the witch knocking the tray right out of her hands her shrieks followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright sunlight harry saw a familiar snowwhite marble building in the distance gringotts bank hagrid had steered him right into diagon alley yer a mess said hagrid gruffly brushing soot off harry so forcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary skulkin around knockturn alley i dunno dodgy place harry don want no one ter see yeh down there i realized that said harry ducking as hagrid made to brush him off again i told you i was lost what were you doing down there anyway i was lookin fer a flesheatin slug repellent growled hagrid theyre ruinin the school cabbages yer not on yer own im staying with the weasleys but we got separated harry explained ive got to go and find them they set off together down the street how come yeh never wrote back ter me said hagrid as harry jogged alongside him he had to take three steps to every stride of hagrids enormous boots harry explained all about dobby and the dursleys lousy muggles growled hagrid if idve known harry harry over here harry looked up and saw hermione granger standing at the top of the white flight of steps to gringotts she ran down to meet them her bushy brown hair flying behind her what happened to your glasses hello hagrid oh its wonderful to see you two again are you coming into gringotts harry as soon as ive found the weasleys said harry yeh wont have long ter wait hagrid said with a grin harry and hermione looked around sprinting up the crowded street were ron fred george percy and mr weasley harry mr weasley panted we hoped youd only gone one grate too far he mopped his glistening bald patch mollys frantic shes coming now where did you come out ron asked knockturn alley said hagrid grimly excellent said fred and george together weve never been allowed in said ron enviously i should ruddy well think not growled hagrid mrs weasley now came galloping into view her handbag swing ing wildly in one hand ginny just clinging onto the other oh harry oh my dear you could have been any where gasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush out of her bag and began sweeping off the soot hagrid hadnt managed to beat away mr weasley took harrys glasses gave them a tap of his wand and returned them good as new well gotta be off said hagrid who was having his hand wrung by mrs weasley knockturn alley if you hadnt found him hagrid see yer at hogwarts and he strode away head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street guess who i saw in borgin and burkes harry asked ron and hermione as they climbed the gringotts steps malfoy and his father did lucius malfoy buy anything said mr weasley sharply behind them no he was selling so hes worried said mr weasley with grim satisfaction oh id love to get lucius malfoy for something you be careful arthur said mrs weasley sharply as they were bowed into the bank by a goblin at the door that familys trouble dont go biting off more than you can chew so you dont think im a match for lucius malfoy said mr weasley indignantly but he was distracted almost at once by the sight of hermiones parents who were standing nervously at the counter that ran all along the great marble hall waiting for hermione to introduce them but youre muggles said mr weasley delightedly we must have a drink whats that youve got there oh youre changing muggle money molly look he pointed excitedly at the tenpound notes in mr grangers hand meet you back here ron said to hermione as the weasleys and harry were led off to their underground vaults by another gringotts goblin the vaults were reached by means of small goblindriven carts that sped along miniature train tracks through the banks underground tunnels harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the weasleys vault but felt dreadful far worse than he had in knockturn alley when it was opened there was a very small pile of silver sickles inside and just one gold galleon mrs weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot into her bag harry felt even worse when they reached his vault he tried to block the contents from view as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a leather bag back outside on the marble steps they all separated percy muttered vaguely about needing a new quill fred and george had spotted their friend from hogwarts lee jordan mrs weasley and ginny were going to a secondhand robe shop mr weasley was insisting on taking the grangers off to the leaky cauldron for a drink well all meet at flourish and blotts in an hour to buy your schoolbooks said mrs weasley setting off with ginny and not one step down knockturn alley she shouted at the twins retreating backs harry ron and hermione strolled off along the winding cobbled street the bag of gold silver and bronze jangling cheerfully in harrys pocket was clamoring to be spent so he bought three large strawberryandpeanutbutter ice creams which they slurped happily as they wandered up the alley examining the fascinating shop windows ron gazed longingly at a full set of chudley cannon robes in the windows of quality quidditch supplies until hermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door in gambol and japes wizarding joke shop they met fred george and lee jordan who were stocking up on dr filibusters fabulous wetstart noheat fireworks and in a tiny junk shop full of broken wands lopsided brass scales and old cloaks covered in potion stains they found percy deeply immersed in a small and deeply boring book called prefects who gained power a study of hogwarts prefects and their later careers ron read aloud off the back cover that sounds fascinating go away percy snapped course hes very ambitious percy hes got it all planned out he wants to be minister of magic ron told harry and hermione in an undertone as they left percy to it an hour later they headed for flourish and blotts they were by no means the only ones making their way to the bookshop as they approached it they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling out side the doors trying to get in the reason for this was proclaimed by a large banner stretched across the upper windows gilderoy lockhart will be signing copies of his autobiography magical me today 1230 pm to 430 pm we can actually meet him hermione squealed i mean hes written almost the whole booklist the crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around mrs weasleys age a harrassedlooking wizard stood at the door saying calmly please ladies dont push there mind the books now harry ron and hermione squeezed inside a long line wound right to the back of the shop where gilderoy lockhart was signing his books they each grabbed a copy of the standard book of spells grade 2 and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the weasleys were standing with mr and mrs granger oh there you are good said mrs weasley she sounded breathless and kept patting her hair well be able to see him in a minute gilderoy lockhart came slowly into view seated at a table surrounded by large pictures of his own face all winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the crowd the real lockhart was wearing robes of forgetmenot blue that exactly matched his eyes his pointed wizards hat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair a short irritablelooking man was dancing around taking photographs with a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with every blinding flash out of the way there he snarled at ron moving back to get a better shot this is for the daily prophet big deal said ron rubbing his foot where the photographer had stepped on it gilderoy lockhart heard him he looked up he saw ron and then he saw harry he stared then he leapt to his feet and positively shouted it cant be harry potter the crowd parted whispering excitedly lockhart dived forward seized harrys arm and pulled him to the front the crowd burst into applause harrys face burned as lockhart shook his hand for the photographer who was clicking away madly wafting thick smoke over the weasleys nice big smile harry said lockhart through his own gleaming teeth together you and i are worth the front page when he finally let go of harrys hand harry could hardly feel his fingers he tried to sidle back over to the weasleys but lockhart threw an arm around his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side ladies and gentlemen he said loudly waving for quiet what an extraordinary moment this is the perfect moment for me to make a little announcement ive been sitting on for some time when young harry here stepped into flourish and blotts today he only wanted to buy my autobiography which i shall be happy to present him now free of charge the crowd applauded again he had no idea lockhart continued giving harry a little shake that made his glasses slip to the end of his nose that he would shortly be getting much much more than my book magical me he and his schoolmates will in fact be getting the real magical me yes ladies and gentlemen i have great pleasure and pride in announcing that this september i will be taking up the post of defense against the dark arts teacher at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry the crowd cheered and clapped and harry found himself being presented with the entire works of gilderoy lockhart staggering slightly under their weight he managed to make his way out of the limelight to the edge of the room where ginny was standing next to her new cauldron you have these harry mumbled to her tipping the books into the cauldron ill buy my own bet you loved that didnt you potter said a voice harry had no trouble recognizing he straightened up and found himself facetoface with draco malfoy who was wearing his usual sneer famous harry potter said malfoy cant even go into a bookshop without making the front page leave him alone he didnt want all that said ginny it was the first time she had spoken in front of harry she was glaring at malfoy potter youve got yourself a girlfriend drawled malfoy ginny went scarlet as ron and hermione fought their way over both clutching stacks of lockharts books oh its you said ron looking at malfoy as if he were something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe bet youre surprised to see harry here eh not as surprised as i am to see you in a shop weasley retorted malfoy i suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all those ron went as red as ginny he dropped his books into the cauldron too and started toward malfoy but harry and hermione grabbed the back of his jacket ron said mr weasley struggling over with fred and george what are you doing its too crowded in here lets go outside well well well arthur weasley it was mr malfoy he stood with his hand on dracos shoulder sneering in just the same way lucius said mr weasley nodding coldly busy time at the ministry i hear said mr malfoy all those raids i hope theyre paying you overtime he reached into ginnys cauldron and extracted from amid the glossy lockhart books a very old very battered copy of a beginners guide to transfiguration obviously not mr malfoy said dear me whats the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they dont even pay you well for it mr weasley flushed darker than either ron or ginny we have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard malfoy he said clearly said mr malfoy his pale eyes straying to mr and mrs granger who were watching apprehensively the company you keep weasley and i thought your family could sink no lower there was a thud of metal as ginnys cauldron went flying mr weasley had thrown himself at mr malfoy knocking him backward into a bookshelf dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering down on all their heads there was a yell of get him dad from fred or george mrs weasley was shrieking no arthur no the crowd stampeded backward knocking more shelves over gentlemen please please cried the assistant and then louder than all break it up there gents break it up hagrid was wading toward them through the sea of books in an instant he had pulled mr weasley and mr malfoy apart mr weasley had a cut lip and mr malfoy had been hit in the eye by an encyclopedia of toadstools he was still holding ginnys old transfiguration book he thrust it at her his eyes glittering with malice here girl take your book its the best your father can give you pulling himself out of hagrids grip he beckoned to draco and swept from the shop yeh shouldve ignored him arthur said hagrid almost lifting mr weasley off his feet as he straightened his robes rotten ter the core the whole family everyone knows that no malfoys worth listenin ter bad blood thats what it is come on now lets get outta here the assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them leaving but he barely came up to hagrids waist and seemed to think better of it they hurried up the street the grangers shaking with fright and mrs weasley beside herself with fury a fine example to set for your children brawling in public what gilderoy lockhart mustve thought he was pleased said fred didnt you hear him as we were leaving he was asking that bloke from the daily prophet if hed be able to work the fight into his report said it was all publicity but it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the leaky cauldron where harry the weasleys and all their shopping would be traveling back to the burrow using floo powder they said goodbye to the grangers who were leaving the pub for the muggle street on the other side mr weasley started to ask them how bus stops worked but stopped quickly at the look on mrs weasleys face harry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before helping himself to floo powder it definitely wasnt his favorite way to travel chapter five the whomping willow the end of the summer vacation came too quickly for harrys liking he was looking forward to getting back to hogwarts but his month at the burrow had been the happiest of his life it was difficult not to feel jealous of ron when he thought of the dursleys and the sort of welcome he could expect next time he turned up on privet drive on their last evening mrs weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinner that included all of harrys favorite things ending with a mouthwatering treacle pudding fred and george rounded off the evening with a display of filibuster fireworks they fiiled the kitchen with red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at least half an hour then it was time for a last mug of hot chocolate and bed it took a long while to get started next morning they were up at dawn but somehow they still seemed to have a great deal to do mrs weasley dashed about in a bad mood looking for spare socks and quills people kept colliding on the stairs halfdressed with bits of toast in their hands and mr weasley nearly broke his neck tripping over a stray chicken as he crossed the yard carrying ginnys trunk to the car harry couldnt see how eight people six large trunks two owls and a rat were going to fit into one small ford anglia he had reckoned of course without the special features that mr weasley had added not a word to molly he whispered to harry as he opened the trunk and showed him how it had been magically expanded so that the luggage fitted easily when at last they were all in the car mrs weasley glanced into the back seat where harry ron fred george and percy were all sitting comfortably side by side and said muggles do know more than we give them credit for dont they she and ginny got into the front seat which had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench i mean youd never know it was this roomy from the outside would you mr weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard harry turning back for a last look at the house he barely had time to wonder when hed see it again when they were back george had forgotten his box of filibuster fireworks five minutes after that they skidded to a halt in the yard so that fred could run in for his broomstick they had almost reached the highway when ginny shrieked that shed left her diary by the time she had clambered back into the car they were running very late and tempers were running high mr weasley glanced at his watch and then at his wife molly dear no arthur no one would see this little button here is an invisibility booster i installed thatd get us up in the air then we fly above the clouds wed be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser i said no arthur not in broad daylight they reached kings cross at a quarter to eleven mr weasley dashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all hurried into the station harry had caught the hogwarts express the previous year the tricky part was getting onto platform nine and threequarters which wasnt visible to the muggle eye what you had to do was walk through the solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten it didnt hurt but it had to be done carefully so that none of the muggles noticed you vanishing percy first said mrs weasley looking nervously at the clock overhead which showed they had only five minutes to disappear casually through the barrier percy strode briskly forward and vanished mr weasley went next fred and george followed ill take ginny and you two come right after us mrs weasley told harry and ron grabbing ginnys hand and setting off in the blink of an eye they were gone lets go together weve only got a minute ron said to harry harry made sure that hedwigs cage was safely wedged on top of his trunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier he felt perfectly confident this wasnt nearly as uncomfortable as using floo powder both of them bent low over the handles of their trolleys and walked purposefully toward the barrier gathering speed a few feet away from it they broke into a run and crash both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward rons trunk fell off with a loud thump harry was knocked off his feet and hedwigs cage bounced onto the shiny floor and she rolled away shrieking indignantly people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled what in blazes dyou think youre doing lost control of the trolley harry gasped clutching his ribs as he got up ron ran to pick up hedwig who was causing such a scene that there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from the surrounding crowd why cant we get through harry hissed to ron i dunno ron looked wildly around a dozen curious people were still watching them were going to miss the train ron whispered i dont understand why the gateways sealed itself harry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pit of his stomach ten seconds nine seconds he wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against the barrier and pushed with all his might the metal remained solid three seconds two seconds one second its gone said ron sounding stunned the trains left what if mum and dad cant get back through to us have you got any muggle money harry gave a hollow laugh the dursleys havent given me pocket money for about six years ron pressed his ear to the cold barrier cant hear a thing he said tensely whatre we going to do i dont know how long itll take mom and dad to get back to us they looked around people were still watching them mainly because of hedwigs continuing screeches i think wed better go and wait by the car said harry were attracting too much atten harry said ron his eyes gleaming the car what about it we can fly the car to hogwarts but i thought were stuck right and weve got to get to school havent we and even underage wizards are allowed to use magic if its a real emergancy section nineteen or something of the restriction of thingy but your mom and dad said harry pushing against the barrier again in the vain hope that it would give way how will they get home they dont need the carsaid ron impatiently they know how to apparate you know just vanish and reappear at home they only bother with the floo powder and the car because were all underage and were not allowed to apparate yet harrys feeling of panic turned to excitment can you fly it no problem said ron wheeling his trolley around to face the exit cmon lets go if we hurry well be able to follow the hogwarts express and they marched off through the crowd of curious muggles out of the station and back onto the side road where the old ford anglia was parked ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand they heaved their luggage back in put hedwig on the back seat and got into the front check that no ones watching said ron starting the ignition with another tap of his wand harry stuck his head out of the window traffic was rumbling along the main road ahead but their street was empty okay he said ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard the car around them vanished and so did they harry could feel the seat vibrating beneath him hear the engine feel his hands on his knees and his glasses on his nose but for all he could see he had become a pair of eyeballs floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars lets go said rons voice from his right and the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away dropping out of sight as the car rose in seconds the whole of london lay smoky and glittering below them then there was a popping noise and the car harry and ron reappeared uhoh said ron jabbing at the invisibility booster its faulty both of them pummeled it the car vanished then it flickered back again hold on ron yelled and he slammed his foot on the accelerator they shot straight into the low woolly clouds and everything turned dull and foggy now what said harry blinking at the solid mass of cloud pressing in on them from all sides we need to see the train to know what direction to go in said ron dip back down again quickly they dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in their seats squinting at the ground i can see it harry yelled right ahead there the hogwarts express was streaking along below them like a scarlet snake due north said ron checking the compass on the dashboard okay well just have to check on it every half hour or so hold on and they shot up through the clouds a minute later they burst out into a blaze of sunlight it was a different world the wheels of the car skimmed the sea of fluffy cloud the sky a bright endless blue under the blinding white sun all weve got to worry about now are airplanes said ron they looked at each other and started to laugh for a long time they couldnt stop it was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream this thought harry was surely the only way to travel past swirls and turrets of snowy cloud in a car full of hot bright sunlight with a fat pack of toffees in the glove compartment and the prospect of seeing freds and georges jealous faces when they landed smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front of hogwarts castle they made regular checks on the train as they flew farther and farther north each dip beneath the clouds showing them a different view london was soon far behind them replaced by neat green fields that gave way in turn to wide purplish moors a great city alive with cars like multicolored ants villages with tiny toy churches several uneventful hours later however harry had to admit that some of the fun was wearing off the toffees had made them extremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink he and ron had pulled off their sweaters but harrys tshirt was sticking to the back of his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the end of his sweaty nose he had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now and was thinking longingly of the train miles below where you could buy icecold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a plump witch why hadnt they been able to get onto platform nine and threequarters cant be much further can it croaked ron hours later still as the sun started to sink into their floor of cloud staining it a deep pink ready for another check on the train it was still right below them winding its way past a snowcapped mountain it was much darker beneath the canopy of clouds ron put his foot on the accelerator and drove them upward again but as he did so the engine began to whine harry and ron exchanged nervous glances its probably just tired said ron its never been this far before and they both pretended not to notice the whining growing louder and louder as the sky became steadily darker stars were blossoming in the blackness harry pulled his sweater back on trying to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving feebly as though in protest not far said ron more to the car than to harry not far now and he patted the dashboard nervously when they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later they had to squint through the darkness for a landmark they knew there harry shouted making ron and hedwig jump straight ahead silhouetted on the dark horizon high on the cliff over the lake stood the many turrets and towers of hogwarts castle but the car had begun to shudder and was losing speed come on ron said cajolingly giving the steering wheel a little shake nearly there come on the engine groaned narrow jets of steam were issuing from under the hood harry found himself gripping the edges of his seat very hard as they flew toward the lake the car gave a nasty wobble glancing out of his window harry saw the smooth black glassy surface of the water a mile below rons knuckles were white on the steering wheel the car wobbled again come on ron muttered they were over the lake the castle was right ahead ron put his foot down there was a loud clunk a splutter and the engine died completely uhoh said ron into the silence the nose of the car dropped they were falling gathering speed heading straight for the solid castle wall noooooo ron yelled swinging the steering wheel around they missed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc soaring over the dark greenhouses then the vegetable patch and then out over the black lawns losing altitude all the time ron let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out of his back pocket stop stop he yelled whacking the dashboard and the windshield but they were still plummeting the ground flying up toward them watch out for that tree harry bellowed lunging for the steering wheel but too late crunch with an earsplitting bang of metal on wood they hit the thick tree trunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt steam was billowing from under the crumpled hood hedwig was shrieking in terror a golfballsize lump was throbbing on harrys head where he had hit the windshield and to his right ron let out a low despairing groan are you okay harry said urgently my wand said ron in a shaky voice look at my wand it had snapped almost in two the tip was dangling limply held on by a few splinters harry opened his mouth to say he was sure theyd be able to mend it up at the school but he never even got started at that very moment something hit his side of the car with the force of a charging bull sending him lurching sideways into ron just as an equally heavy blow hit the roof whats happen ron gasped staring through the windshield and harry looked around just in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it the tree they had hit was attacking them its trunk was bent almost double and its gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it could reach aaargh said ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent into his door the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from knucklelike twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was pounding furiously on the roof which seemed to be caving in run for it ron shouted throwing his full weight against his door but next second he had been knocked backward into harrys lap by a vicious uppercut from another branch were done for he moaned as the ceiling sagged but suddenly the floor of the car was vibrating the engine had restarted reverse harry yelled and the car shot backward the tree was still trying to hit them they could hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped itself up lashing out at them as they sped out of reach that panted ron was close well done car the car however had reached the end of its tether with two sharp clunks the doors flew open and harry felt his seat tip sideways next thing he knew he was sprawled on the damp ground loud thuds told him that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk hedwigs cage flew through the air and burst open she rose out of it with an angry screech and sped off toward the castle without a backward look then dented scratched and steaming the car rumbled off into the darkness its rear lights blazing angrily come back ron yelled after it brandishing his broken wand dadll kill me but the car disappeared from view with one last snort from its exhaust can you believe our luck said ron miserably bending down to pick up scabbers of all the trees we couldve hit we had to get one that hits back he glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree which was still flailing its branches threateningly come on said harry wearily wed better get up to the school it wasnt at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured stiff cold and bruised they seized the ends of their trunks and began dragging them up the grassy slope toward the great oak front doors i think the feasts already started said ron dropping his trunk at the foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a brightly lit window hey harry come and look its the sorting harry hurried over and together he and ron peered in at the great hall innumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long crowded tables making the golden plates and goblets sparkle overhead the bewitched ceiling which always mirrored the sky outside sparkled with stars through the forest of pointed black hogwarts hats harry saw a long line of scaredlooking first years fiiing into the hall ginny was among them easily visible because of her vivid weasley hair meanwhile professor mcgonagall a bespectacled witch with her hair in a tight bun was placing the famous hogwarts sorting hat on a stool before the newcomers every year this aged old hat patched frayed and dirty sorted new students into the four hogwarts houses gryffindor hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin harry well remembered putting it on exactly one year ago and waiting petrified for its decision as it muttered aloud in his ear for a few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in slytherin the house that had turned out more dark witches and wizards than any other but he had ended up in gryffindor along with ron hermione and the rest of the weasleys last term harry and ron had helped gryffindor win the house championship beating slytherin for the first time in seven years a very small mousyhaired boy had been called forward to place the hat on his head harrys eyes wandered past him to where professor dumbledore the headmaster sat watching the sorting from the staff table his long silver beard and halfmoon glasses shining brightly in the candlelight several seats along harry saw gilderoy lockhart dressed in robes of aquamarine and there at the end was hagrid huge and hairy drinking deeply from his goblet hang on harry muttered to ron theres an empty chair at the staff table wheres snape professor severus snape was harrys least favorite teacher harry also happened to be snapes least favorite student cruel sarcastic and disliked by everybody except the students from his own house slytherin snape taught potions maybe hes ill said ron hopefully maybe hes left said harry because he missed out on the defense against dark arts job again or he might have been sacked said ron enthusiastically i mean everyone hates him or maybe said a very cold voice right behind them hes waiting to hear why you two didnt arrive on the school train harry spun around there his black robes rippling in a cold breeze stood severus snape he was a thin man with sallow skin a hooked nose and greasy shoulderlength black hair and at this moment he was smiling in a way that told harry he and ron were in very deep trouble follow me said snape not daring even to look at each other harry and ron followed snape up the steps into the vast echoing entrance hall which was lit with flaming torches a delicious smell of food was wafting from the great hall but snape led them away from the warmth and light down a narrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons in he said opening a door halfway down the cold passageway and pointing they entered snapes office shivering the shadowy walls were lined with shelves of large glass ars in which floated all manner of revolting things harry didnt really want to know the name of at the moment the fireplace was dark and empty snape closed the door and turned to look at them so he said softly the train isnt good enough for the famous harry potter and his faithful sidekick weasley wanted to arrive with a bang did we boys no sir it was the barrier at kings cross it silence said snape coldly what have you done with the car ron gulped this wasnt the first time snape had given harry the impression of being able to read minds but a moment later he understood as snape unrolled todays issue of the evening prophet you were seen he hissed showing them the headline flying ford anglia mystifies muggles he began to read aloud two muggles in london convinced they saw an old car flying over the post office tower at noon in norfolk mrs hetty bayliss while hanging out her washing mr angus fleet of peebles reported to police six or seven muggles in all i believe your father works in the misuse of muggle artifacts office he said looking up at ron and smiling still more nastily dear dear his own son harry felt as though hed just been walloped in the stomach by one of the mad trees larger branches if anyone found out mr weasley had bewitched the car he hadnt thought of that i noticed in my search of the park that considerable damage seems to have been done to a very valuable whomping willow snape went on that tree did more damage to us than we ron blurted out silence snapped snape again most unfortunately you are not in my house and the decision to expel you does not rest with me i shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power you will wait here harry and ron stared at each other whitefaced harry didnt feel hungry any more he now felt extremely sick he tried not to look at a large slimy something suspended in green liquid on a shelf behind snapes desk if snape had gone to fetch professor mcgonagall head of gryffindor house they were hardly any better off she might be fairer than snape but she was still extremely strict ten minutes later snape returned and sure enough it was professor mcgonagall who accompanied him harry had seen professor mcgonagall angry on several occasions but either he had forgotten just how thin her mouth could go or he had never seen her this angry before she raised her wand the moment she entered harry and ron both flinched but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace where flames suddenly erupted sit she said and they both backed into chairs by the fire explain she said her glasses glinting ominously ron launched into the story starting with the barrier at the station refusing to let them through so we had no choice professor we couldnt get on the train why didnt you send us a letter by owl i believe you have an owl professor mcgonagall said coldly to harry harry gaped at her now she said it that seemed the obvious thing to have done i i didnt think that said professor mcgonagall is obvious there was a knock on the office door and snape now looking happier than ever opened it there stood the headmaster professor dumbledore harrys whole body went numb dumbledore was looking unusually grave he stared down his very crooked nose at them and harry suddenly found himself wishing he and ron were still being beaten up by the whomping willow there was a long silence then dumbledore said please explain why you did this it would have been better if he had shouted harry hated the disappointment in his voice for some reason he was unable to look dumbledore in the eyes and spoke instead to his knees he told dumbledore everything except that mr weasley owned the bewitched car making it sound as though he and ron had happened to find a flying car parked outside the station he knew dumbledore would see through this at once but dumbledore asked no questions about the car when harry had finished he merely continued to peer at them through his spectacles well go and get our stuff said ron in a hopeless sort of voice what are you talking about weasley barked professor mcgonagall well youre expelling us arent you said ron harry looked quickly at dumbledore not today mr weasley said dumbledore but i must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done i will be writing to both your families tonight i must also warn you that if you do anything like this again i will have no choice but to expel you snape looked as though christmas had been canceled he cleared his throat and said professor dumbledore these boys have flouted the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree surely acts of this nature it will be for professor mcgonagall to decide on these boys punishments severus said dumbledore calmly they are in her house and are therefore her responsibility he turned to professor mcgonagall i must go back to the feast minerva ive got to give out a few notices come severus theres a delicious looking custard tart i want to sample snape shot a look of pure venom at harry and ron as he allowed himself to be swept out of his office leaving them alone with professor mcgonagall who was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle youd better get along to the hospital wing weasley youre bleeding not much said ron hastily wiping the cut over his eye with his sleeve professor i wanted to watch my sister being sorted the sorting ceremony is over said professor mcgonagall your sister is also in gryffindor oh good said ron and speaking of gryffindor professor mcgonagall said sharply but harry cut in professor when we took the car term hadnt started so so gryffindor shouldnt really have points taken from it should it he finished watching her anxiously professor mcgonagall gave him a piercing look but he was sure she had almost smiled her mouth looked less thin anyway i will not take any points from gryffindor she said and harrys heart lightened considerably but you will both get a detention it was better than harry had expected as for dumbledores writing to the dursleys that was nothing harry knew perfectly well theyd just be disappointed that the whomping willow hadnt squashed him flat professor mcgonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at snapes desk a large plate of sandwiches two silver goblets and a jug oficed pumpkin juice appeared with a pop you will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory she said i must also return to the feast when the door had closed behind her ron let out a long low whistle i thought wed had it he said grabbing a sandwich so did i said harry taking one too can you believe our luck though said ron thickly through a mouthful of chicken and ham fred and george mustve flown that car five or six times and no muggle ever saw them he swallowed and took another huge bite why couldnt we get through the barrier harry shrugged well have to watch our step from now on though he said taking a grateful swig of pumpkin juice wish we couldve gone up to the feast she didnt want us showing off said ron sagely doesnt want people to think its clever arriving by flying car when they had eaten as many sandwiches as they could the plate kept refilling itself they rose and left the office treading the familiar path to gryffindor tower the castle was quiet it seemed that the feast was over they walked past muttering portraits and creaking suits of armor and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs until at last they reached the passage where the secret entrance to gryffindor tower was hidden behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress password she said as they approached er said harry they didnt know the new years password not having met a gryffindor prefect yet but help came almost immediately they heard hurrying feet behind them and turned to see hermione dashing toward them there you are where have you been the most ridiculous rumors someone said youd been expelled for crashing a flying car well we havent been expelled harry assured her youre not telling me you did fly here said hermione sounding almost as severe as professor mcgonagall skip the lecture said ron impatiently and tell us the new password its wattlebird said hermione impatiently but thats not the point her words were cut short however as the portrait of the fat lady swung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping it looked as though the whole of gryffindor house was still awake packed into the circular common room standing on the lopsided tables and squashy armchairs waiting for them to arrive arms reached through the portrait hole to pull harry and ron inside leaving hermione to scramble in after them brilliant yelled lee jordan inspired what an entrance flying a car right into the whomping willow peoplell be talking about that one for years good for you said a fifth year harry had never spoken to someone was patting him on the back as though hed just won a marathon fred and george pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said together why couldnt weve come in the car eh ron was scarlet in the face grinning embarrassedly but harry could see one person who didnt look happy at all percy was visible over the heads of some excited first years and he seemed to be trying to get near enough to start telling them off harry nudged ron in the ribs and nodded in percys direction ron got the point at once got to get upstairs bit tired he said and the two of them started pushing their way toward the door on the other side of the room which led to a spiral staircase and the dormitories night harry called back to hermione who was wearing a scowl just like percys they managed to get to the other side of the common room still having their backs slapped and gained the peace of the staircase they hurried up it right to the top and at last reached the door of their old dormitory which now had a sign on it saying second years they entered the familiar circular room with its five fourposters hung with red velvet and its high narrow windows their trunks had been brought up for them and stood at the ends of their beds ron grinned guiltily at harry i know i shouldntve enjoyed that or anything but the dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year gryffindor boys seamus finnigan dean thomas and neville longbottom unbelievable beamed seamus cool said dean amazing said neville awestruck harry couldnt help it he grinned too chapter six gilderoy lockhart the next day however harry barely grinned once things started to go downhill from breakfast in the great hall the four long house tables were laden with tureens of porridge plates of kippers mountains of toast and dishes of eggs and bacon beneath the enchanted ceiling today a dull cloudy gray harry and ron sat down at the gryffindor table next to hermione who had her copy of voyages with vampires propped open against a milk jug there was a slight stiffness in the way she said morning which told harry that she was still disapproving of the way they had arrived neville longbottom on the other hand greeted them cheerfully neville was a roundfaced and accidentprone boy with the worst memory of anyone harry had ever met mails due any minute i think grans sending a few things i forgot harry had only just started his porridge when sure enough there was a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls streamed in circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd a big lumpy package bounced off nevilles head and a second later something large and gray fell into hermiones jug spraying them all with milk and feathers enrol said ron pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet errol slumped unconscious onto the table his legs in the air and a damp red envelope in his beak oh no ron gasped its all right hes still alive said hermione prodding errol gently with the tip of her finger its not that its that ron was pointing at the red envelope it looked quite ordinary to harry but ron and neville were both looking at it as though they expected it to explode whats the matter said harry shes shes sent me a howler said ron faintly youd better open it ron said neville in a timid whisper itll be worse if you dont my gran sent me one once and i ignored it and he gulped it was horrible harry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope whats a howler he said but rons whole attention was fixed on the letter which had begun to smoke at the corners open it neville urged itll all be over in a few minutes ron stretched out a shaking hand eased the envelope from errols beak and slit it open neville stuffed his fingers in his ears a split second later harry knew why he thought for a moment it had exploded a roar of sound fiiled the huge hall shaking dust from the ceiling stealing the car i wo uldnt have been surprised if theyd expelled you you wait till i get hold of you i dont suppose you stopped to think what your father and i went through when we saw it was gone mrs weasleys yells a hundred times louder than usual made the plates and spoons rattle on the table and echoed deafeningly off the stone walls people throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had received the howler and ron sank so low in his chair that only his crimson forehead could be seen letter from dumbledore last night i thought your father would die of shame we didnt bring you up to behave like this you and harry could both have died harry had been wondering when his name was going to crop up he tried very hard to look as though he couldnt hear the voice that was making his eardrums throb absolutelydisgusted your fathers facing an inquiry at work its entirely your fault and if you put another toe out of line well bring you straight back home a ringing silence fell the red envelope which had dropped from rons hand burst into flames and curled into ashes harry and ron sat stunned as though a tidal wave had just passed over them a few people laughed and gradually a babble of talk broke out again hermione closed voyages with vampires and looked down at the top of rons head well i dont know what you expected ron but you dont tell me i deserved it snapped ron harry pushed his porridge away his insides were burning with guilt mr weasley was facing an inquiry at work after all mr and mrs weasley had done for him over the summer but he had no time to dwell on this professor mcgonagall was moving along the gryffindor table handing out course schedules harry took his and saw that they had double herbology with the hufflepuffs first harry ron and hermione left the castle together crossed the vegetable patch and made for the greenhouses where the magical plants were kept at least the howler had done one good thing hermione seemed to think they had now been punished enough and was being perfectly friendly again as they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the class standing outside waiting for professor sprout harry ron and hermione had only just joined them when she came striding into view across the lawn accompanied by gilderoy lockhart professor sprouts arms were full of bandages and with another twinge of guilt harry spotted the whomping willow in the distance several of its branches now in slings professor sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over her flyaway hair there was usually a large amount of earth on her clothes and her fingernails would have made aunt petunia faint gilderoy lockhart however was immaculate in sweeping robes of turquoise his golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoise hat with gold trimming oh hello there he called beaming around at the assembled students just been showing professor sprout the right way to doctor a whomping willow but i dont want you running away with the idea that im better at herbology than she is i just happen to have met several of these exotic plants on my travels greenhouse three today chaps said professor sprout who was looking distinctly disgruntled not at all her usual cheerful self there was a murmur of interest they had only ever worked in greenhouse one before greenhouse three housed far more interesting and dangerous plants professor sprout took a large key from her belt and unlocked the door harry caught a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant umbrellasized flowers dangling from the ceiling he was about to follow ron and hermione inside when lockharts hand shot out harry ive been wanting a word you dont mind if hes a couple of minutes late do you professor sprout judging by professor sprouts scowl she did mind but lockhart said thats the ticket and closed the greenhouse door in her face harry said lockhart his large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight as he shook his head harry harry harry completely nonplussed harry said nothing when i heard well of course it was all my fault could have kicked myself harry had no idea what he was talking about he was about to say so when lockhart went on dont know when ive been more shocked flying a car to hogwarts well of course i knew at once why youd done it stood out a mile harry harry harry it was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant teeth even when he wasnt talking gave you a taste for publicity didnt i said lockhart gave you the bug you got onto the front page of the paper with me and you couldnt wait to do it again oh no professor see harry harry harry said lockhart reaching out and grasping his shoulder i understand natural to want a bit more once youve had that first taste and i blame myself for giving you that be cause it was bound to go to your head but see here young man you cant start flying cars to try and get yourself noticed just calm down all right plenty of time for all that when youre older yes yes i know what youre thinking its all right for him hes an in ternationally famous wizard already but when i was twelve i was just as much of a nobody as you are now in fact id say i was even more of a nobody i mean a few people have heard of you havent they all that business with heomust notbenamed he glanced at the lightning scar on harrys forehead i know i know its not quite as good as winning witch weeklys most charmingsmile award five times in a row as i have but its a start harry its a start he gave harry a hearty wink and strode off harry stood stunned for a few seconds then remembering he was supposed to be in the greenhouse he opened the door and slid inside professor sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the center of the greenhouse about twenty pairs of differentcolored earmuffs were lying on the bench when harry had taken his place between ron and hermione she said well be repotting mandrakes today now who can tell me the properties of the mandrake to nobodys surprise hermiones hand was first into the air mandrake or mandragora is a powerful restorative said hermione sounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook it is used to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their original state excellent ten points to gryffindor said professor sprout the mandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes it is also however dangerous who can tell me why hermiones hand narrowly missed harrys glasses as it shot up again the cry of the mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it she said promptly precisely take another ten points said professor sprout now the mandrakes we have here are still very young she pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke and everyone shuffled forward for a better look a hundred or so tufty little plants purplish green in color were growing there in rows they looked quite unremarkable to harry who didnt have the slightest idea what hermione meant by the cry of the mandrake everyone take a pair of earmuffs said professor sprout there was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair that wasnt pink and fluffy when i tell you to put them on make sure your ears are completely covered said professor sprout when it is safe to remove them i will give you the thumbsup right earmuffs on harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears they shut out sound completely professor sprout put the pink fluffy pair over her own ears rolled up the sleeves of her robes grasped one of the tufty plants firmly and pulled hard harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear instead of roots a small muddy and extremely ugly baby popped out of the earth the leaves were growing right out of his head he had pale green mottled skin and was clearly bawling at the top of his lungs professor sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and plunged the mandrake into it burying him in dark damp compost until only the tufted leaves were visible professor sprout dusted off her hands gave them all the thumbsup and removed her own earmuffs as our mandrakes are only seedlings their cries wont kill yet she said calmly as though shed just done nothing more exciting than water a begonia however they will knock you out for several hours and as im sure none of you want to miss your first day back make sure your earmuffs are securely in place while you work i will attract your attention when it is time to pack up four to a tray there is a large supply of pots here compost in the sacks over there and be careful of the venemous tentacula its teething she gave a sharp slap to a spiky dark red plant as she spoke making it draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over her shoulder harry ron and hermione were joined at their tray by a curlyhaired hufflepuff boy harry knew by sight but had never spoken to justin finchfletchley he said brightly shaking harry by the hand know who you are of course the famous harry potter and youre hermione granger always top in everything hermione beamed as she had her hand shaken too and ron weasley wasnt that your flying car ron didnt smile the howler was obviously still on his mind that lockharts something isnt he said justin happily as they began fiiling their plant pots with dragon dung compost awfully brave chap have you read his books id have died of fear if id been cornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf but he stayed cool and zap just fantastic my name was down for eton you know i cant tell you how glad i am i came here instead of course mother was slightly disappointed but since i made her read lockharts books i think shes begun to see how useful itll be to have a fully trained wizard in the family after that they didnt have much chance to talk their earmuffs were back on and they needed to concentrate on the mandrakes professor sprout had made it look extremely easy but it wasnt the mandrakes didnt like coming out of the earth but didnt seem to want to go back into it either they squirmed kicked flailed their sharp little fists and gnashed their teeth harry spent ten whole minutes trying to squash a particularly fat one into a pot by the end of the class harry like everyone else was sweaty aching and covered in earth everyone traipsed back to the castle for a quick wash and then the gryffindors hurried off to transfiguration professor mcgonagalls classes were always hard work but today was especially difficult everything harry had learned last year seemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer he was supposed to be turning a beetle into a button but all he managed to do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the desktop avoiding his wand ron was having far worse problems he had patched up his wand with some borrowed spellotape but it seemed to be damaged beyond repair it kept crackling and sparking at odd moments and every time ron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smoke that smelled of rotten eggs unable to see what he was doing ron accidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for a new one professor mcgonagall wasnt pleased harry was relieved to hear the lunch bell his brain felt like a wrung sponge everyone fiied out of the classroom except him and ron who was whacking his wand furiously on the desk stupid useless thing write home for another one harry suggested as the wand let off a volley of bangs like a firecracker oh yeah and get another howler back said ron stuffing the now hissing wand into his bag its your own fault your wand got snapped they went down to lunch where rons mood was not improved by hermiones showing them the handful of perfect coat buttons she had produced in transfiguration whatve we got this afternoon said harry hastily changing the subject defense against the dark arts said hermione at once why demanded ron seizing her schedule have you outlined all lockharts lessons in little hearts hermione snatched the schedule back blushing furiously they finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyard hermione sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in voyages with vampires again harry and ron stood talking about quidditch for several minutes before harry became aware that he was being closely watched looking up he saw the very small mousyhaired boy hed seen trying on the sorting hat last night staring at harry as though transfixed he was clutching what looked like an ordinary muggle camera and the moment harry looked at him he went bright red all right harry im im colin creevey he said breathlessly taking a tentative step forward im in gryffindor too dyou think would it be all right if can i have a picture he said raising the camera hopefully a picture harry repeated blankly so i can prove ive met you said colin creevey eagerly edging further forward i know all about you everyones told me about how you survived when youknowwho tried to kill you and how he disappeared and everything and how youve still got a lightning scar on your forehead his eyes raked harrys hairline and a boy in my dormitory said if i develop the film in the right potion the picturesll move colin drew a great shuddering breath of excitement and said its amazing here isnt it i never knew all the odd stuff i could do was magic till i got the letter from hogwarts my dads a milkman he couldnt believe it either so im taking loads of pictures to send home to him and itd be really good if i had one of you he looked imploringly at harry maybe your friend could take it and i could stand next to you and then could you sign it signed photos youre giving out signed photos potter loud and scathing draco malfoys voice echoed around the courtyard he had stopped right behind colin flanked as he always was at hogwarts by his large and thuggish cronies crabbe and goyle everyone line up malfoy roared to the crowd harry potters giving out signed photos no im not said harry angrily his fists clenching shut up malfoy youre just jealous piped up colin whose entire body was about as thick as crabbes neck jealoussaid malfoy who didnt need to shout anymore half the courtyard was listening in of what i dont want a foul scar right across my head thanks i dont think getting your head cut open makes you that special myself crabbe and goyle were sniggering stupidly eat slugs malfoy said ron angrily crabbe stopped laughing and started rubbing his knuckles in a menacing way be careful weasley sneered malfoy you dont want to start any trouble or your mommyll have to come and take you away from school he put on a shrill piercing voice if you put another toe out of line a knot of slytherin fifthyears nearby laughed loudly at this weasley would like a signed photo potter smirked malfoy itd be worth more than his familys whole house ron whipped out his spellotaped wand but hermione shut voyages with vampires with a snap and whispered look out whats all this whats all this gilderoy lockhart was striding toward them his turquoise robes swirling behind him whos giving out signed photos harry started to speak but he was cut short as lockhart flung an arm around his shoulders and thundered jovially shouldnt have asked we meet again harry pinned to lockharts side and burning with humiliation harry saw malfoy slide smirking back into the crowd come on then mr creevey said lockhart beaming at colin a double portrait cant do better than that and well both sign it for you colin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bell rang behind them signaling the start of afternoon classes off you go move along there lockhart called to the crowd and he set off back to the castle with harry who was wishing he knew a good vanishing spell still clasped to his side a word to the wise harry said lockhart paternally as they entered the building through a side door i covered up for you back there with young creevey if he was photographing me too your schoolmates wont think youre setting yourself up so much deaf to harrys stammers lockhart swept him down a corridor lined with staring students and up a staircase let me just say that handing out signed pictures at this stage of your career isnt sensible looks a tad bigheaded harry to be frank there may well come a time when like me youll need to keep a stack handy wherever you go but he gave a little chor tle i dont think youre quite there yet they had reached lockharts classroom and he let harry go at last harry yanked his robes straight and headed for a seat at the very back of the class where he busied himself with piling all seven of lockharts books in front of him so that he could avoid looking at the real thing the rest of the class came clattering in and ron and hermione sat down on either side of harry you couldve fried an egg on your face said ron youd better hope creevey doesnt meet ginny or theyll be starting a harry potter fan club shut up snapped harry the last thing he needed was for lockhart to hear the phrase harry potter fan club when the whole class was seated lockhart cleared his throat loudly and silence fell he reached forward picked up neville longbottoms copy of travels with trolls and held it up to show his own winking portrait on the front me he said pointing at it and winking as well gilderoy lockhart order of merlin third class honorary member of the dark force defense league and fivetime winner of witch weeklys most charmingsmile award but i dont talk about that i didnt get rid of the bandon banshee by smiling at her he waited for them to laugh a few people smiled weakly i see youve all bought a complete set of my books well done i thought wed start today with a little quiz nothing to worry about just to check how well youve read them how much youve taken in when he had handed out the test papers he returned to the front of the class and said you have thirty minutes start now harry looked down at his paper and read 1 what is gilderoy lockhart s favorite color 2 what is gilderoy lockharts secret ambition 3 what in your opinion is gilderoy lockharts greatest achievement to date on and on it went over three sides of paper right down to 4 when is gilderoy lockharts birthday and what would his ideal gift be half an hour later lockhart collected the papers and rifled through them in front of the class tut tut hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color is lilac i say so in year with the yeti and a few of you need to read wanderings with werewolves more carefully i clearly state in chapter twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all magic and nonmagic peoples though i wouldnt say no to a large bottle of ogdeds old firewhisky he gave them another roguish wink ron was now staring at lockhart with an expression of disbelief on his face seamus finnigan and dean thomas who were sitting in front were shaking with silent laughter hermione on the other hand was listening to lockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when he mentioned her name but miss hermione granger knew my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of haircare potions good girl in fact he flipped her paper over full marks where is miss hermione granger hermione raised a trembling hand excellent beamed lockhart quite excellent take ten points for gryffindor and so to business he bent down behind his desk and lifted a large covered cage onto it now be warned it is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind you may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room know only that no harm can befall you whilst i am here all i ask is that you remain calm in spite of himself harry leaned around his pile of books for a better look at the cage lockhart placed a hand on the cover dean and seamus had stopped laughing now neville was cowering in his front row seat i must ask you not to scream said lockhart in a low voice it might provoke them as the whole class held its breath lockhart whipped off the cover yes he said dramatically freshly caught cornish pixies seamus finnigan couldnt control himself he let out a snort of laughter that even lockhart couldnt mistake for a scream of terror yes he smiled at seamus well theyre not theyre not very dangerous are they seamus choked dont be so sure said lockhart waggling a finger annoyingly at seamus devilish tricky little blighters they can be the pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high with pointed faces and voices so shrill it was like listening to a lot of budgies arguing the moment the cover had been removed they had started jabbering and rocketing around rattling the bars and making bizarre faces at the people nearest them right then lockhart said loudly lets see what you make of them and he opened the cage it was pandemonium the pixies shot in every direction like rockets two of them seized neville by the ears and lifted him into the air several shot straight through the window showering the back row with broken glass the rest proceeded to wreck the classroom more effectively than a rampaging rhino they grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class with them shredded books and papers tore pictures from the walls upended the waste basket grabbed bags and books and threw them out of the smashed window within minutes half the class was sheltering under desks and neville was swinging from the iron chandelier in the ceiling come on now round them up round them up theyre only pixies lockhart shouted he rolled up his sleeves brandished his wand and bellowed peskipiksi pesternomi it had absolutely no effect one of the pixies seized his wand and threw it out of the window too lockhart gulped and dived under his own desk narrowly avoiding being squashed by neville who fell a second later as the chandelier gave way the bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit in the relative calm that followed lockhart straightened up caught sight of harry ron and hermione who were almost at the door and said well ill ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage he swept past them and shut the door quickly behind him can you believe him roared ron as one of the remaining pixies bit him painfully on the ear he just wants to give us some handson experience said hermione immobilizing two pixies at once with a clever freezing charm and stuffing them back into their cage hands on said harry who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of reach with its tongue out hermione he didnt have a clue what he was doing rubbish said hermione youve read his books look at all those amazing things hes done he says hes done ron muttered chapter seven mudbloods and murmurs harry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sight whenever he saw gilderoy lockhart coming down a corridor harder to avoid was colin creevey who seemed to have memorized harrys schedule nothing seemed to give colin a bigger thrill than to say all right harry six or seven times a day and hear hello colin back however exasperated harry sounded when he said it hedwig was still angry with harry about the disasterous car journey and rons wand was still malfunctioning surpassing itself on friday morning by shooting out of rons hand in charms and hitting tiny old professor flitwick squarely between the eyes creating a large throbbing green boil where it had struck so with one thing and another harry was quite glad to reach the weekend he ron and hermione were planning to visit hagrid on saturday morning harry however was shaken awake several hours earlier than he would have liked by oliver wood captain of the gryffindor quidditch team whassamatter said harry groggily quidditch practice said wood come on harry squinted at the window there was a thin mist hanging across the pinkandgold sky now that he was awake he couldnt understand how he could have slept through the racket the birds were making oliver harry croaked its the crack of dawn exactly said wood he was a tall and burly sixth year and at the moment his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm its part of our new training program come on grab your broom and lets go said wood heartily none of the other teams have started training yet were going to be first off the mark this year yawning and shivering slightly harry climbed out of bed and tried to find his quidditch robes good man said wood meet you on the field in fifteen minutes when hed found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for warmth harry scribbled a note to ron explaining where hed gone and went down the spiral staircase to the common room his nimbus two thousand on his shoulder he had just reached the portrait hole when there was a clatter behind him and colin creevey came dashing down the spiral staircase his camera swinging madly around his neck and something clutched in his hand i heard someone saying your name on the stairs harry look what ive got here ive had it developed i wanted to show you harry looked bemusedly at the photograph colin was brandishing under his nose a moving blackandwhite lockhart was tugging hard on an arm harry recognized as his own he was pleased to see that his photographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to be dragged into view as harry watched lockhart gave up and slumped panting against the white edge of the picture will you sign it said colin eagerly no said harry flatly glancing around to check that the room was really deserted sorry colin im in a hurry quidditch practice he climbed through the portrait hole oh wow wait for me ive never watched a quidditch game before colin scrambled through the hole after him itll be really boring harry said quickly but colin ignored him his face shining with excitement you were the youngest house player in a hundred years werent you harry werent you said colin trotting alongside him you must be brilliant ive never flown is it easy is that your own broom is that the best one there is harry didnt know how to get rid of him it was like having an extremely talkative shadow i dont really understand quidditch said colin breathlessly is it true there are four balls and two of them fly around trying to knock people off their brooms yes said harry heavily resigned to explaining the complicated rules of quidditch theyre called bludgers there are two beaters on each team who carry clubs to beat the bludgers away from their side fred and george weasley are the gryffindor beaters and what are the other balls for colin asked tripping down a couple of steps because he was gazing openmouthed at harry well the quaffle thats the biggish red one is the one that scores goals three chasers on each team throw the quaffle to each other and try and get it through the goal posts at the end of the pitch theyre three long poles with hoops on the end and the fourth ball is the golden snitch said harry and its very small very fast and difficult to catch but thats what the seekers got to do because a game of quidditch doesnt end until the snitch has been caught and whichever teams seeker gets the snitch earns his team an extra hundred and fifty points and youre the gryffindor seeker arent you said colin in awe yes said harry as they left the castle and started across the dewdrenched grass and theres the keeper too he guards the goal posts thats it really but colin didnt stop questioning harry all the way down the sloping lawns to the quidditch field and harry only shook him off when he reached the changing rooms colin called after him in a piping voice ill go and get a good seat harry and hurried off to the stands the rest of the gryffindor team were already in the changing room wood was the only person who looked truly awake fred and george weasley were sitting puffyeyed and touslehaired next to fourth year alicia spinnet who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind her her fellow chasers katie bell and angelina johnson were yawning side by side opposite them there you are harry what kept you said wood briskly now i wanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field because i spent the summer devising a whole new training program which i really think will make all the difference wood was holding up a large diagram of a quidditch field on which were drawn many lines arrows and crosses in differentcolored inks he took out his wand tapped the board and the arrows began to wiggle over the diagram like caterpillars as wood launched into a speech about his new tactics fred weasleys head drooped right onto alicia spinnets shoulder and he began to snore the first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain but there was another board under that and a third under that one harry sank into a stupor as wood droned on and on so said wood at long last jerking harry from a wistful fantasy about what he could be eating for breakfast at this very moment up at the castle is that clear any questions ive got a question oliver said george who had woken with a start why couldnt you have told us all this yesterday when we were awake wood wasnt pleased now listen here you lot he said glowering at them all we should have won the quidditch cup last year were easily the best team but unfortunately owing to circumstances beyond our control harry shifted guiltily in his seat he had been unconscious in the hospital wing for the final match of the previous year meaning that gryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worst defeat in three hundred years wood took a moment to regain control of himself their last defeat was clearly still torturing him so this year we train harder than ever before okay lets go and put our new theories into practice wood shouted seizing his broomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms stifflegged and still yawning his team followed they had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up completely now although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the stadium as harry walked onto the field he saw ron and hermione sitting in the stands arent you finished yet called ron incredulously havent even started said harry looking jealously at the toast and marmalade ron and hermione had brought out of the great hall woods been teaching us new moves he mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground soaring up into the air the cool morning air whipped his face waking him far more effectively than woods long talk it felt wonderful to be back on the quidditch field he soared right around the stadium at full speed racing fred and george whats that funny clicking noise called fred as they hurtled around the corner harry looked into the stands colin was sitting in one of the highest seats his camera raised taking picture after picture the sound strangely magnified in the deserted stadium look this way harry this way he cried shrilly whos that said fred no idea harry lied putting on a spurt of speed that took him as far away as possible from colin whats going on said wood frowning as he skimmed through the air toward them whys that first year taking pictures i dont like it he could be a slytherin spy trying to find out about our new training program hes in gryffindor said harry quickly and the slytherins dont need a spy oliver said george what makes you say that said wood testily because theyre here in person said george pointing several people in green robes were walking onto the field broomsticks in their hands i dont believe it wood hissed in outrage i booked the field for today well see about this wood shot toward the ground landing rather harder than he meant to in his anger staggering slightly as he dismounted harry fred and george followed flint wood bellowed at the slytherin captain this is our practice time we got up specially you can clear off now marcus flint was even larger than wood he had a look of trollish cunning on his face as he replied plenty of room for all of us wood angelina alicia and katie had come over too there were no girls on the slytherin team who stood shoulder to shoulder facing the gryffindors leering to a man but i booked the field said wood positively spitting with rage i booked it ah said flint but ive got a specially signed note here from professor snape i professor s snape give the slytherin team permission to practice today on the quidditch field owing to the need to train their new seeker youve got a new seeker said wood distracted where and from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh smaller boy smirking all over his pale pointed face it was draco malfoy arent you lucius malfoys son said fred looking at malfoy with dislike funny you should mention dracos father said flint as the whole slytherin team smiled still more broadly let me show you the generous gift hes made to the slytherin team all seven of them held out their broomsticks seven highly polished brand new handles and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling the words nimbus two thousand and one gleamed under the gryffindors noses in the early morning sun very latest model only came out last month said flint carelessly flicking a speck of dust from the end of his own i believe it outstrips the old two thousand series by a considerable amount as for the old cleansweeps he smiled nastily at fred and george who were both clutching cleansweep fives sweeps the board with them none of the gryffindor team could think of anything to say for a moment malfoy was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reduced to slits oh look said flint a field invasion ron and hermione were crossing the grass to see what was going on whats happening ron asked harry why arent you playing and whats he doing here he was looking at malfoy taking in his slytherin quidditch robes im the new slytherin seeker weasley said malfoy smugly everyones just been admiring the brooms my fathers bought our team ron gaped openmouthed at the seven superb broomsticks in front of him good arent they said malfoy smoothly but perhaps the gryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms too you could raffle off those cleansweep fives i expect a museum would bid for them the slytherin team howled with laughter at least no one on the gryffindor team had to buy their way in said hermione sharply they got in on pure talent the smug look on malfoys face flickered no one asked your opinion you fiithy little mudblood he spat harry knew at once that malfoy had said something really bad because there was an instant uproar at his words flint had to dive in front of malfoy to stop fred and george jumping on him alicia shrieked how dare you and ron plunged his hand into his robes pulled out his wand yelling youll pay for that one malfoy and pointed it furiously under flints arm at malfoys face a loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shot out of the wrong end of rons wand hitting him in the stomach and sending him reeling backward onto the grass ron ron are you all right squealed hermione ron opened his mouth to speak but no words came out instead he gave an almighty belch and several slugs dribbled out of his mouth onto his lap the slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter flint was doubled up hanging onto his new broomstick for support malfoy was on all fours banging the ground with his fist the gryffindors were gathered around ron who kept belching large glistening slugs nobody seemed to want to touch him wed better get him to hagrids its nearest said harry to hermione who nodded bravely and the pair of them pulled ron up by the arms what happened harry what happened is he ill but you can cure him cant you colin had run down from his seat and was now dancing alongside them as they left the field ron gave a huge heave and more slugs dribbled down his front oooh said colin fascinated and raising his camera can you hold him still harry get out of the way colin said harry angrily he and hermione supported ron out of the stadium and across the grounds toward the edge of the forest nearly there ron said hermione as the gamekeepers cabin came into view youll be all right in a minute almost there they were within twenty feet of hagrids house when the front door opened but it wasnt hagrid who emerged gilderoy lockhart wearing robes of palest mauve today came striding out quick behind here harry hissed dragging ron behind a nearby bush hermione followed somewhat reluctantly its a simple matter if you know what youre doing lockhart was saying loudly to hagrid if you need help you know where i am ill let you have a copy of my book im surprised you havent already got one ill sign one tonight and send it over well goodbye and he strode away toward the castle harry waited until lockhart was out of sight then pulled ron out of the bush and up to hagrids front door they knocked urgently hagrid appeared at once looking very grumpy but his expression brightened when he saw who it was bin wonderin when youd come ter see me come in come in thought you mighta bin professor lockhart back again harry and hermione supported ron over the threshold into the one roomed cabin which had an enormous bed in one corner a fire crackling merrily in the other hagrid didnt seem perturbed by rons slug problem which harry hastily explained as he lowered ron into a chair better out than in he said cheerfully plunking a large copper basin in front of him get em all up ron i dont think theres anything to do except wait for it to stop said hermione anxiously watching ron bend over the basin thats a difficult curse to work at the best of times but with a broken wand hagrid was bustling around making them tea his boarhound fang was slobbering over harry what did lockhart want with you hagrid harry asked scratching fangs ears givin me advice on gettin kelpies out of a well growled hagrid moving a halfplucked rooster off his scrubbed table and setting down the teapot like i don know an bangin on about some banshee he banished if one word of it was true ill eat my kettle it was most unlike hagrid to criticize a hogwarts teacher and harry looked at him in surprise hermione however said in a voice somewhat higher than usual i think youre being a bit unfair professor dumbledore obviously thought he was the best man for the job he was the only man for the job said hagrid offering them a plate of treacle fudge while ron coughed squelchily into his basin an i mean the on one gettin very difficult ter find anyone fer the dark arts job people arent too keen ter take it on see theyre startin ter think its jinxed no ones lasted long fer a while now so tell me said hagrid jerking his head at ron who was he tryin ter curse malfoy called hermione something it mustve been really bad because everyone went wild it was bad said ron hoarsely emerging over the tabletop looking pale and sweaty malfoy called her mudblood hagrid ron dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs made their appearance hagrid looked outraged he didn he growled at hermione he did she said but i dont know what it means i could tell it was really rude of course its about the most insulting thing he could think of gasped ron coming back up mudbloods a really foul name for someone who is muggleborn you know nonmagic parents there are some wizards like malfoys family who think theyre better than everyone else because theyre what people call pure blood he gave a small burp and a single slug fell into his outstretched hand he threw it into the basin and continued i mean the rest of us know it doesnt make any difference at all look at neville longbottom hes pureblood and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right way up an they havent invented a spell our hermione can do said hagrid proudly making hermione go a brilliant shade of magenta its a disgusting thing to call someone said ron wiping his sweaty brow with a shaking hand dirty blood see common blood its ridiculous most wizards these days are halfblood anyway if we hadnt married muggles wedve died out he retched and ducked out of sight again well i don blame yeh fer tryin ter curse him ron said hagrid loudly over the thuds of more slugs hitting the basin bu maybe it was a good thing yer wand backfired spect lucius malfoy wouldve come marchin up ter school if yehd cursed his son least yer not in trouble harry would have pointed out that trouble didnt come much worse than having slugs pouring out of your mouth but he couldnt hagrids treacle fudge had cemented his jaws together harry said hagrid abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought gotta bone ter pick with yeh ive heard youve bin givin out signed photos how come i havent got one furious harry wrenched his teeth apart i have not been giving out signed photos he said hotly if lockharts still spreading that around but then he saw that hagrid was laughing im ony jokin he said patting harry genially on the back and sending him face first into the table i knew yeh hadnt really i told lockhart yeh didn need teh yer more famous than him without tryin bet he didnt like that said harry sitting up and rubbing his chin don think he did said hagrid his eyes twinkling an then i told him id never read one o his books an he decided ter go treacle fudge ron he added as ron reappeared no thanks said ron weakly better not risk it come an see what ive bin growin said hagrid as harry and hermione finished the last of their tea in the small vegetable patch behind hagrids house were a dozen of the largest pumpkins harry had ever seen each was the size of a large boulder gettin on well arent they said hagrid happily fer the halloween feast should be big enough by then whatve you been feeding them said harry hagrid looked over his shoulder to check that they were alone well ive bin givin them you know a bit o help harry noticed hagrids flowery pink umbrella leaning against the back wall of the cabin harry had had reason to believe before now that this umbrella was not all it looked in fact he had the strong impression that hagrids old school wand was concealed inside it hagrid wasnt supposed to use magic he had been expelled from hogwarts in his third year but harry had never found out why any mention of the matter and hagrid would clear his throat loudly and become mysteriously deaf until the subject was changed an engorgement charm i suppose said hermione halfway between disapproval and amusement well youve done a good job on them thats what yer little sister said said hagrid nodding at ron met her jus yesterday hagrid looked sideways at harry his beard twitching said she was jus lookin round the grounds but i reckon she was hopin she might run inter someone else at my house he winked at harry if yeh ask me she wouldn say no ter a signed oh shut up said harry ron snorted with laughter and the ground was sprayed with slugs watch it hagrid roared pulling ron away from his precious pumpkins it was nearly lunchtime and as harry had only had one bit of treacle fudge since dawn he was keen to go back to school to eat they said goodbye to hagrid and walked back up to the castle ron hiccoughing occasionally but only bringing up two very small slugs they had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall when a voice rang out there you are potter weasley professor mcgonagall was walking toward them looking stern you will both do your detentions this evening whatre we doing professor said ron nervously suppressing a burp you will be polishing the silver in the trophy room with mr filch said professor mcgonagall and no magic weasley elbow grease ron gulped argus filch the caretaker was loathed by every student in the school and you potter will be helping professor lockhart answer his fan mail said professor mcgonagall oh no professor cant i go and do the trophy room too said harry desperately certainly not said professor mcgonagall raising her eyebrows professor lockhart requested you particularly eight oclock sharp both of you harry and ron slouched into the great hall in states of deepest gloom hermione behind them wearing a wellyoudidbreakschoolrules sort of expression harry didnt enjoy his shepherds pie as much as hed thought both he and ron felt theyd got the worse deal filchll have me there all night said ron heavily no magic there must be about a hundred cups in that room im no good at muggle cleaning id swap anytime said harry hollowly ive had loads of practice with the dursleys answering lockharts fan mail hell be a nightmare saturday afternoon seemed to melt away and in what seemed like no time it was five minutes to eight and harry was dragging his feet along the second floor corridor to lockharts office he gritted his teeth and knocked the door flew open at once lockhart beamed down at him ah heres the scalawag he said come in harry come in shining brightly on the walls by the light of many candles were countless framed photographs of lockhart he had even signed a few of them another large pile lay on his desk you can address the envelopes lockhart told harry as though this was a huge treat this first ones to gladys gudgeon bless her huge fan of mine the minutes snailed by harry let lockharts voice wash over him occasionally saying mmm and right and yeah now and then he caught a phrase like fames a fickle friend harry or celebrity is as celebrity does remember that the candles burned lower and lower making the light dance over the many moving faces of lockhart watching him harry moved his aching hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope writing out veronica smethleys address it must be nearly time to leave harry thought miserably please let it be nearly time and then he heard something something quite apart from the spitting of the dying candles and lockharts prattle about his fans it was a voice a voice to chill the bone marrow a voice of breathtaking icecold venom come come to me let me rip you let me tear you let me kill you harry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot appeared on veronica smethleys street what he said loudly i know said lockhart six solid months at the top of the bestseller list broke all records no said harry frantically that voice sorry said lockhart looking puzzled what voice that that voice that said didnt you hear it lockhart was looking at harry in high astonishment what are you talking about harry perhaps youre getting a little drowsy great scott look at the time weve been here nearly four hours id never have believed it the times flown hasnt it harry didnt answer he was straining his ears to hear the voice again but there was no sound now except for lockhart telling him he mustnt expect a treat like this every time he got detention feeling dazed harry left it was so late that the gryffindor common room was almost empty harry went straight up to the dormitory ron wasnt back yet harry pulled on his pajamas got into bed and waited half an hour later ron arrived nursing his right arm and bringing a strong smell of polish into the darkened room my muscles have all seized up he groaned sinking on his bed fourteen times he made me buff up that quidditch cup before he was satisfied and then i had another slug attack all over a special award for services to the school took ages to get the slime off how was it with lockhart keeping his voice low so as not to wake neville dean and seamus harry told ron exactly what he had heard and lockhart said he couldnt hear it said ron harry could see him frowning in the moonlight dyou think he was lying but i dont get it even someone invisible wouldve had to open the door i know said harry lying back in his fourposter and staring at the canopy above him i dont get it either chapter eight the deathday party october arrived spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle madam pomfrey the nurse was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students her pepperup potion worked instantly though it left the drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward ginny weasley who had been looking pale was bullied into taking some by percy the steam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the impression that her whole head was on fire raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on end the lake rose the flower beds turned into muddy streams and hagrids pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds oliver woods enthusiasm for regular training sessions however was not dampened which was why harry was to be found late one stormy saturday afternoon a few days before halloween returning to gryffindor tower drenched to the skin and splattered with mud even aside from the rain and wind it hadnt been a happy practice session fred and george who had been spying on the slytherin team had seen for themselves the speed of those new nimbus two thousand and ones they reported that the slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs shooting through the air like missiles as harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as he was nearly headless nick the ghost of gryffindor tower was staring morosely out of a window muttering under his breath dont fulfill their requirements half an inch if that hello nick said harry hello hello said nearly headless nick starting and looking round he wore a dashing plumed hat on his long curly hair and a tunic with a ruff which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed he was pale as smoke and harry could see right through him to the dark sky and torrential rain outside you look troubled young potter said nick folding a transparent letter as he spoke and tucking it inside his doublet so do you said harry ah nearly headless nick waved an elegant hand a matter of no importance its not as though i really wanted to join thought id apply but apparently i dont fulfill requirements in spite of his airy tone there was a look of great bitterness on his face but you would think wouldnt you he erupted suddenly pulling the letter back out of his pocket that getting hit forty five times in the neck with a blunt axe would qualify you to join the headless hunt oh yes said harry who was obviously supposed to agree i mean nobody wishes more than i do that it had all been quick and clean and my head had come off properly i mean it would have saved me a great deal of pain and ridicule however nearly headless nick shook his letter open and read furiously we can only accept huntsmen whose heads have parted company with their bodies you will appreciate that it would be impossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such as horseback headjuggling and head polo it is with the greatest regret therefore that i must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements with very best wishes sir patrick delaney podmore fuming nearly headless nick stuffed the letter away half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on harry most people would think thats good and beheaded but oh no its not enough for sir properly decapitatedpodmore nearly headless nick took several deep breaths and then said in a far calmer tone so whats bothering you anything i can do no said harry not unless you know where we can get seven free nimbus two thousand and ones for our match against sly the rest of harrys sentence was drowned out by a highpitched mewling from somewhere near his ankles he looked down and found himself gazing into a pair of lamplike yellow eyes it was mrs norris the skeletal gray cat who was used by the caretaker argus filch as a sort of deputy in his endless battle against students youd better get out of here harry said nick quickly filch isnt in a good mood hes got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered frog brains all over the ceiling in dungeon five hes been cleaning all morning and if he sees you dripping mud all over the place right said harry backing away from the accusing stare of mrs norris but not quickly enough drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that seemed to connect him with his foul cat argus filch burst suddenly through a tapestry to harrys right wheezing and looking wildly about for the rulebreaker there was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head and his nose was unusually purple filth he shouted his jowls aquiver his eyes popping alarmingly as he pointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from harrys quidditch robes mess and muck everywhere ive had enough of it i tell you follow me potter so harry waved a gloomy goodbye to nearly headless nick and followed filch back downstairs doubling the number of muddy footprints on the floor harry had never been inside filchs office before it was a place most students avoided the room was dingy and windowless lit by a single oil lamp dangling from the low ceiling a faint smell of fried fish lingered about the place wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls from their labels harry could see that they contained details of every pupil filch had ever punished fred and george weasley had an entire drawer to themselves a highly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind filchs desk it was common knowledge that he was always begging dumbledore to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling filch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and began shuffling around looking for parchment dung he muttered furiously great sizzling dragon bogies frog brains rat intestines ive had enough of it make an example wheres the form yes he retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretched it out in front of him dipping his long black quill into the ink pot name harry potter crime it was only a bit of mud said harry its only a bit of mud to you boy but to me its an extra hour scrubbing shouted filch a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose crime befouling the castle suggested sentence dabbing at his streaming nose filch squinted unpleasantly at harry who waited with bated breath for his sentence to fall but as filch lowered his quill there was a great bang on the ceiling of the office which made the oil lamp rattle peeves filch roared flinging down his quill in a transport of rage ill have you this time ill have you and without a backward glance at harry filch ran flatfooted from the office mrs norris streaking alongside him peeves was the school poltergeist a grinning airborne menace who lived to cause havoc and distress harry didnt much like peeves but couldnt help feeling grateful for his timing hopefully whatever peeves had done and it sounded as though hed wrecked something very big this time would distract filch from harry thinking that he should probably wait for filch to come back harry sank into a motheaten chair next to the desk there was only one thing on it apart from his halfcompleted form a large glossy purple envelope with silver lettering on the front with a quick glance at the door to check that filch wasnt on his way back harry picked up the envelope and read kwikspell a correspondence course in beginners magic intrigued harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of parchment inside more curly silver writing on the front page said feel out of step in the world of modern magic find yourself making excuses not to perform simple spells ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork there is an answer kwikspell is an allnew failsafe quickresult easylearn course hundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the kwikspell method madam z nettles of topsham writes i had no memory for incantations and my potions were a family joke now after a kwikspell course i am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe of my scintillation solution warlock d j prod of didsbury says my wife used to sneer at my feeble charms but one month into your fabulous kwikspell course and i succeeded in turning her into a yak thank you kwikspell fascinated harry thumbed through the rest of the envelopes contents why on earth did filch want a kwikspell course did this mean he wasnt a proper wizard harry was just reading lesson one holding your wand some useful tips when shuffling footsteps outside told him filch was coming back stuffing the parchment back into the envelope harry threw it back onto the desk just as the door opened filch was looking triumphant that vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable he was saying gleefully to mrs norris well have peeves out this time my sweet his eyes fell on harry and then darted to the kwikspell envelope which harry realized too late was lying two feet away from where it had started filchs pasty face went brick red harry braced himself for a tidal wave of fury filch hobbled across to his desk snatched up the envelope and threw it into a drawer have you did you read he sputtered no harry lied quickly filchs knobbly hands were twisting together if i thought youd read my private not that its mine for a friend be that as it may however harry was staring at him alarmed filch had never looked madder his eyes were popping a tic was going in one of his pouchy cheeks and the tartan scarf didnt help very well go and dont breathe a word not that however if you didnt read go now i have to write up peeves report go amazed at his luck harry sped out of the office up the corridor and back upstairs to escape from filchs office without punishment was probably some kind of school record harry harry did it work nearly headless nick came gliding out of a classroom behind him harry could see the wreckage of a large blackandgold cabinet that appeared to have been dropped from a great height i persuaded peeves to crash it right over filchs office said nick eagerly thought it might distract him was that you said harry gratefully yeah it worked i didnt even get detention thanks nick they set off up the corridor together nearly headless nick harry noticed was still holding sir patricks rejection letter i wish there was something i could do for you about the headless hunt harry said nearly headless nick stopped in his tracks and harry walked right through him he wished he hadnt it was like stepping through an icy shower but there is something you could do for me said nick excitedly harry would i be asking too much but no you wouldnt want what is it said harry well this halloween will be my five hundredth deathday said nearly headless nick drawing himself up and looking dignified oh said harry not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about this right im holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons friends will be coming from all over the country it would be such an honor if you would attend mr weasley and miss granger would be most welcome too of course but i daresay youd rather go to the school feast he watched harry on tenterhooks no said harry quickly ill come my dear boy harry potter at my deathday party and he hesitated looking excited do you think you could possibly mention to sir patrick how very frightening and impressive you find me of of course said harry nearly headless nick beamed at him a deathday party said hermione keenly when harry had changed at last and joined her and ron in the common room i bet there arent many living people who can say theyve been to one of those itll be fascinating why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died said ron who was halfway through his potions homework and grumpy sounds dead depressing to me rain was still lashing the windows which were now inky black but inside all looked bright and cheerful the firelight glowed over the countless squashy armchairs where people sat reading talking doing homework or in the case of fred and george weasley trying to find out what would happen if you fed a filibuster firework to a salamander fred had rescued the brilliant orange fire dwelling lizard from a care of magical creatures class and it was now smouldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of curious people harry was at the point of telling ron and hermione about filch and the kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room the sight of percy bellowing himself hoarse at fred and george the spectacular display of tangerine stars showering from the salamanders mouth and its escape into the fire with accompanying explosions drove both filch and the kwikspell envelope from harrys mind by the time halloween arrived harry was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party the rest of the school was happily anticipating their halloween feast the great hall had been decorated with the usual live bats hagrids vast pumpkins had been carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in and there were rumors that dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the entertainment a promise is a promise hermione reminded harry bossily you said youd go to the deathday party so at seven oclock harry ron and hermione walked straight past the doorway to the packed great hall which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and candles and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons the passageway leading to nearly headless nicks party had been lined with candles too though the effect was far from cheerful these were long thin jetblack tapers all burning bright blue casting a dim ghostly light even over their own living faces the temperature dropped with every step they took as harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around him he heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard is that supposed to be music ron whispered they turned a corner and saw nearly headless nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes my dear friends he said mournfully welcome welcome so pleased you could come he swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside it was an incredible sight the dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly white translucent people mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor waltzing to the dreadful quavering sound of thirty musical saws played by an orchestra on a raised blackdraped platform a chandelier overhead blazed midnightblue with a thousand more black candles their breath rose in a mist before them it was like stepping into a freezer shall we have a look around harry suggested wanting to warm up his feet careful not to walk through anyone said ron nervously and they set off around the edge of the dance floor they passed a group of gloomy nuns a ragged man wearing chains and the fat friar a cheerful hufflepuff ghost who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead harry wasnt surprised to see that the bloody baron a gaunt staring slytherin ghost covered in silver bloodstains was being given a wide berth by the other ghosts oh no said hermione stopping abruptly turn back turn back i dont want to talk to moaning myrtle who said harry as they backtracked quickly she haunts one of the toilets in the girls bathroom on the first floor said hermione she haunts a toilet yes its been outoforder all year because she keeps having tantrums and flooding the place i never went in there anyway if i could avoid it its awful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you look food said ron on the other side of the dungeon was a long table also covered in black velvet they approached it eagerly but next moment had stopped in their tracks horrified the smell was quite disgusting large rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters cakes burned charcoalblack were heaped on salvers there was a great maggoty haggis a slab of cheese covered in furry green mold and in pride of place an enormous gray cake in the shape of a tombstone with tarlike icing forming the words sir nicholas de mimsyporpington died 31st october 1492 harry watched amazed as a portly ghost approached the table crouched low and walked through it his mouth held wide so that it passed through one of the stinking salmon can you taste it if you walk though it harry asked him almost said the ghost sadly and he drifted away i expect theyve let it rot to give it a stronger flavor said hermione knowledgeably pinching her nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid haggis can we move i feel sick said ron they had barely turned around however when a little man swooped suddenly from under the table and came to a halt in midair before them hello peeves said harry cautiously unlike the ghosts around them peeves the poltergeist was the very reverse of pale and transparent he was wearing a bright orange party hat a revolving bow tie and a broad grin on his wide wicked face nibbles he said sweetly offering them a bowl of peanuts covered in fungus no thanks said hermione heard you talking about poor myrtle said peeves his eyes dancing rude you was about poor myrtle he took a deep breath and bellowed oy myrtle oh no peeves dont tell her what i said shell be really upset hermione whispered frantically i didnt mean it i dont mind her er hello myrtle the squat ghost of a girl had glided over she had the glummest face harry had ever seen halfhidden behind lank hair and thick pearly spectacles what she said sulkily how are you myrtle said hermione in a falsely bright voice its nice to see you out of the toilet myrtle sniffed miss granger was just talking about you said peeves slyly in myrtles ear just saying saying how nice you look tonight said hermione glaring at peeves myrtle eyed hermione suspiciously youre making fun of me she said silver tears welling rapidly in her small seethrough eyes no honestly didnt i just say how nice myrtles looking said hermione nudging harry and ron painfully in the ribs oh yeah she did dont lie to me myrtle gasped tears now flooding down her face while peeves chuckled happily over her shoulder dyou think i dont know what people call me behind my back fat myrtle ugly myrtle miserable moaning moping myrtle youve forgotten pimply peeves hissed in her ear moaning myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled from the dungeon peeves shot after her pelting her with moldy peanuts yelling pimply pimply oh dear said hermione sadly nearly headless nick now drifted toward them through the crowd enjoying yourselves oh yes they lied not a bad turnout said nearly headless nick proudly the wailing widow came all the way up from kent its nearly time for my speech id better go and warn the orchestra the orchestra however stopped playing at that very moment they and everyone else in the dungeon fell silent looking around in excitement as a hunting horn sounded oh here we go said nearly headless nick bitterly through the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses each ridden by a headless horseman the assembly clapped wildly harry started to clap too but stopped quickly at the sight of nicks face the horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted rearing and plunging at the front of the pack was a large ghost who held his bearded head under his arm from which position he was blowing the horn the ghost leapt down lifted his head high in the air so he could see over the crowd everyone laughed and strode over to nearly headless nick squashing his head back onto his neck nick he roared how are you head still hanging in there he gave a hearty guffaw and clapped nearly headless nick on the shoulder welcome patrick said nick stiffly live uns said sir patrick spotting harry ron and hermione and giving a huge fake jump of astonishment so that his head fell off again the crowd howled with laughter very amusing said nearly headless nick darkly dont mind nick shouted sir patricks head from the floor still upset we wont let him join the hunt but i mean to say look at the fellow i think said harry hurriedly at a meaningful look from nick nicks very frightening and er ha yelled sir patricks head bet he asked you to say that if i could have everyones attention its time for my speech said nearly headless nick loudly striding toward the podium and climbing into an icy blue spotlight my late lamented lords ladies and gentlemen it is my great sorrow but nobody heard much more sir patrick and the rest of the headless hunt had just started a game of head hockey and the crowd were turning to watch nearly headless nick tried vainly to recapture his audience but gave up as sir patricks head went sailing past him to loud cheers harry was very cold by now not to mention hungry i cant stand much more of this ron muttered his teeth chattering as the orchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dance floor lets go harry agreed they backed toward the door nodding and beaming at anyone who looked at them and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full of black candles pudding might not be finished yet said ron hopefully leading the way toward the steps to the entrance hall and then harry heard it rip tear kill it was the same voice the same cold murderous voice he had heard in lockharts office he stumbled to a halt clutching at the stone wall listening with all his might looking around squinting up and down the dimly lit passageway harry whatre you its that voice again shut up a minute soo hungry for so long listen said harry urgently and ron and hermione froze watching him kill time to kill the voice was growing fainter harry was sure it was moving away moving upward a mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he stared at the dark ceiling how could it be moving upward was it a phantom to whom stone ceilings didnt matter this way he shouted and he began to run up the stairs into the entrance hall it was no good hoping to hear anything here the babble of talk from the halloween feast was echoing out of the great hall harry sprinted up the marble staircase to the first floor ron and hermione clattering behind him harry whatre we shh harry strained his ears distantly from the floor above and growing fainter still he heard the voice i smell blood i smell blood his stomach lurched its going to kill someone he shouted and ignoring rons and hermiones bewildered faces he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time trying to listen over his own pounding footsteps harry hurtled around the whole of the second floor ron and hermione panting behind him not stopping until they turned a corner into the last deserted passage harry what was that all about said ron wiping sweat off his face i couldnt hear anything but hermione gave a sudden gasp pointing down the corridor look something was shining on the wall ahead they approached slowly squinting through the darkness foothigh words had been daubed on the wall between two windows shimmering in the light cast by the flaming torches the chamber of secrets has been opened enemies of the heir beware whats that thing hanging underneath said ron a slight quiver in his voice as they edged nearer harry almost slipped there was a large puddle of water on the floor ron and hermione grabbed him and they inched toward the message eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it all three of them realized what it was at once and leapt backward with a splashmrs norris the caretakers cat was hanging by her tail from the torch bracket she was stiff as a board her eyes wide and staring for a few seconds they didnt move then ron said lets get out of here shouldnt we try and help harry began awkwardly trust me said ron we dont want to be found here but it was too late a rumble as though of distant thunder told them that the feast had just ended from either end of the corridor where they stood came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs and the loud happy talk of wellfed people next moment students were crashing into the passage from both ends the chatter the bustle the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted the hanging cat harry ron and hermione stood alone in the middle of the corridor as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see the grisly sight then someone shouted through the quiet enemies of the heir beware youll be next mudbloods it was draco malfoy he had pushed to the front of the crowd his cold eyes alive his usually bloodless face flushed as he grinned at the sight of the hanging immobile cat chapter nine the writing on the wall whats going on here whats going on attracted no doubt by malfoys shout argus filch came shouldering his way through the crowd then he saw mrs norris and fell back clutching his face in horror my cat my cat whats happened to mrs norris he shrieked and his popping eyes fell on harry youhe screeched you youve murdered my cat youve killed her ill kill you ill argus dumbledore had arrived on the scene followed by a number of other teachers in seconds he had swept past harry ron and hermione and detached mrs norris from the torch bracket come with me argus he said to filch you too mr potter mr weasley miss granger lockhart stepped forward eagerly my office is nearest headmaster just upstairs please feel free thank you gilderoy said dumbledore the silent crowd parted to let them pass lockhart looking excited and important hurried after dumbledore so did professors mcgonagall and snape as they entered lockharts darkened office there was a flurry of movement across the walls harry saw several of the lockharts in the pictures dodging out of sight their hair in rollers the real lockhart lit the candles on his desk and stood back dumbledore lay mrs norris on the polished surface and began to examine her harry ron and hermione exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool of candlelight watching the tip of dumbledores long crooked nose was barely an inch from mrs norriss fur he was looking at her closely through his halfmoon spectacles his long fingers gently prodding and poking professor mcgonagall was bent almost as close her eyes narrowed snape loomed behind them half in shadow wearing a most peculiar expression it was as though he was trying hard not to smile and lockhart was hovering around all of them making suggestions it was definitely a curse that killed her probably the transmogrifian torture ive seen it used many times so unlucky i wasnt there i know the very countercurse that would have saved her lockharts comments were punctuated by filchs dry racking sobs he was slumped in a chair by the desk unable to look at mrs norris his face in his hands much as he detested filch harry couldnt help feeling a bit sorry for him though not nearly as sorry as he felt for himself if dumbledore believed filch he would be expelled for sure dumbledore was now muttering strange words under his breath and tapping mrs norris with his wand but nothing happened she continued to look as though she had been recently stuffed i remember something very similar happening in ouagadogou said lockhart a series of attacks the full storys in my autobiography i was able to provide the townsfolk with various amulets which cleared the matter up at once the photographs of lockhart on the walls were all nodding in agreement as he talked one of them had forgotten to remove his hair net at last dumbledore straightened up shes not dead argus he said softly lockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number of murders he had prevented not dead choked filch looking through his fingers at mrs norris but whys she all all stiff and frozen she has been petrified said dumbledore ah i thought so said lockhart but how i cannot say ask him shrieked filch turning his blotched and tearstained face to harry no second year could have done this said dumbledore firmly it would take dark magic of the most advanced he did it he did it filch spat his pouchy face purpling you saw what he wrote on the wall he found in my office he knows im a im a filchs face worked horribly he knows im a squib he finished i never touched mrs norris harry said loudly uncomfortably aware of everyone looking at him including all the lockharts on the walls and i dont even know what a squib is rubbish snarled filch he saw my kwikspell letter if i might speak headmaster said snape from the shadows and harrys sense of forboding increased he was sure nothing snape had to say was going to do him any good potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time he said a slight sneer curling his mouth as though he doubted it but we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here why was he in the upstairs corridor at all why wasnt he at the halloween feast harry ron and hermione all launched into an explanation about the deathday party there were hundreds of ghosts theyll tell you we were there but why not join the feast afterward said snape his black eyes glittering in the candlelight why go up to that corridor ron and hermione looked at harry because because harry said his heart thumping very fast something told him it would sound very farfetched if he told them he had been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear because we were tired and wanted to go to bed he said without any supper said snape a triumphant smile flickering across his gaunt face i didnt think ghosts provided food fit for living people at their parties we werent hungry said ron loudly as his stomach gave a huge rumble snapes nasty smile widened i suggest headmaster that potter is not being entirely truthful he said it might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privileges until he is ready to tell us the whole story i personally feel he should be taken off the gryffindor quidditch team until he is ready to be honest really severus said professor mcgonagall sharply i see no reason to stop the boy playing quidditch this cat wasnt hit over the head with a broomstick there is no evidence at all that potter has done anything wrong dumbledore was giving harry a searching look his twinkling lightblue gaze made harry feel as though he were being xrayed innocent until proven guilty severus he said firmly snape looked furious so did filch my cat has been petrified he shrieked his eyes popping i want to see some punishment we will be able to cure her argus said dumbledore patiently professer sprout recently managed to procure some mandrakes as soon as they have reached their full size i will have a potion made that will revive mrs norris ill make it lockhart butted in i must have done it a hundred times i could whip up a mandrake restorative draught in my sleep excuse me said snape icily but i believe i am the potions master at this school there was a very awkward pause you may go dumbledore said to harry ron and hermione they went as quickly as they could without actually running when they were a floor up from lockharts office they turned into an empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them harry squinted at his friends darkened faces dyou think i should have told them about that voice i heard no said ron without hesitation hearing voices no one else can hear isnt a good sign even in the wizarding world something in rons voice made harry ask you do believe me dont you course i do said ron quickly but you must admit its weird i know its weird said harry the whole things weird what was that writing on the wall about the cbamber has been opened whats that supposed to mean you know it rings a sort of bell said ron slowly i think someone told me a story about a secret chamber at hogwarts once mightve been bill and what on earths a squib said harry to his surprise ron stifled a snigger well its not funny really but as its filch he said a squib is someone who was born into a wizarding family but hasnt got any magic powers kind of the opposite of muggleborn wizards but squibs are quite unusual if filchs trying to learn magic from a kwikspell course i reckon he must be a squib it would explain a lot like why he hates students so much ron gave a satisfied smile hes bitter a clock chimed somewhere midnight said harry wed better get to bed before snape comes along and tries to frame us for something else for a few days the school could talk of little else but the attack on mrs norris filch kept it fresh in everyones minds by pacing the spot where she had been attacked as though he thought the attacker might come back harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wall with mrs skowers allpurpose magical mess remover but to no effect the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone when filch wasnt guarding the scene of the crime he was skulking red eyed through the corridors lunging out at unsuspecting students and trying to put them in detention for things like breathing loudly and looking happy ginny weasley seemed very disturbed by mrs norriss fate according to ron she was a great cat lover but you havent really got to know mrs norris ron told her bracingly honestly were much better off without her ginnys lip trembled stuff like this doesnt often happen at hogwarts ron assured her theyll catch the maniac who did it and have him out of here in no time i just hope hes got time to petrify filch before hes expelled im only joking ron added hastily as ginny blanched the attack had also had an effect on hermione it was quite usual for hermione to spend a lot of time reading but she was now doing almost nothing else nor could harry and ron get much response from her when they asked what she was up to and not until the following wednesday did they find out harry had been held back in potions where snape had made him stay behind to scrape tubeworms off the desks after a hurried lunch he went upstairs to meet ron in the library and saw justin finchfletchley the hufflepuff boy from herbology coming toward him harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when justin caught sight of him turned abruptly and sped off in the opposite direction harry found ron at the back of the library measuring his history of magic homework professor binns had asked for a three footlong composition on the medieval assembly of european wizards i dont believe it im still eight inches short said ron furiously letting go of his parchment which sprang back into a roll and hermiones done four feet seven inches and her writings tiny where is she asked harry grabbing the tape measure and unrolling his own homework somewhere over there said ron pointing along the shelves looking for another book i think shes trying to read the whole library before christmas harry told ron about justin finchfletchley running away from him dunno why you care i thought he was a bit of an idiot said ron scribbling away making his writing as large as possible all that junk about lockhart being so great hermione emerged from between the bookshelves she looked irritable and at last seemed ready to talk to them all the copies of hogwarts a history have been taken out she said sitting down next to harry and ron and theres a twoweek waiting list i wish i hadnt left my copy at home but i couldnt fit it in my trunk with all the lockhart books why do you want it said harry the same reason everyone else wants it said hermione to read up on the legend of the chamber of secrets whats that said harry quickly thats just it i cant remember said hermione biting her lip and i cant find the story anywhere else hermione let me read your composition said ron desperately checking his watch no i wont said hermione suddenly severe youve had ten days to finish it i only need another two inches come on the bell rang ron and hermione led the way to history of magic bickering history of magic was the dullest subject on their schedule professor binns who taught it was their only ghost teacher and the most exciting thing that ever happened in his classes was his entering the room through the blackboard ancient and shriveled many people said he hadnt noticed he was dead he had simply got up to teach one day and left his body behind him in an armchair in front of the staff room fire his routine had not varied in the slightest since today was as boring as ever professor binns opened his notes and began to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly everyone in the class was in a deep stupor occasionally coming to long enough to copy down a name or date then falling asleep again he had been speaking for half an hour when something happened that had never happened before hermione put up her hand professor binns glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lecture on the international warlock convention of 1289 looked amazed miss er granger professor i was wondering if you could tell us anything about the chamber of secrets said hermione in a clear voice dean thomas who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open gazing out of the window jerked out of his trance lavender browns head came up off her arms and neville longbottoms elbow slipped off his desk professor binns blinked my subject is history of magic he said in his dry wheezy voice i deal with facts miss granger not myths and legends he cleared his throat with a small noise like chalk sping and continued in september of that year a subcommittee of sardinian sorcerers he stuttered to a halt hermiones hand was waving in the air again miss grant please sir dont legends always have a basis in fact professor binns was looking at her in such amazement harry was sure no student had ever interrupted him before alive or dead well said professor binns slowly yes one could argue that i suppose he peered at hermione as though he had never seen a student properly before however the legend of which you speak is such a very sensational even ludicrous tale but the whole class was now hanging on professor binnss every word he looked dimly at them all every face turned to his harry could tell he was completely thrown by such an unusual show of interest oh very well he said slowly let me see the chamber of secrets you all know of course that hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago the precise date is uncertain by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age the four school houses are named after them godric gryffindor helga hufflepuff rowena ravenclaw and salazar slytherin they built this castle together far from prying muggle eyes for it was an age when magic was feared by common people and witches and wizards suffered much persecution he paused gazed blearily around the room and continued for a few years the founders worked in harmony together seeking out youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be educated but then disagreements sprang up between them a rift began to grow between slytherin and the others slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to hogwarts he believed that magical learning should be kept within allmagic families he disliked taking students of muggle parentage believing them to be untrustworthy after a while there was a serious argument on the subject between slytherin and gryffindor and slytherin left the school professor binns paused again pursing his lips looking like a wrinkled old tortoise reliable historical sources tell us this much he said but these honest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the chamber of secrets the story goes that slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the castle of which the other founders knew nothing slytherin according to the legend sealed the chamber of secrets so that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at the school the heir alone would be able to unseal the chamber of secrets unleash the horror within and use it to purge the school of all who were unworthy to study magic there was silence as he finished telling the story but it wasnt the usual sleepy silence that filled professor binnss classes there was unease in the air as everyone continued to watch him hoping for more professor binns looked faintly annoyed the whole thing is arrant nonsense of course he said naturally the school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber many times by the most learned witches and wizards it does not exist a tale told to frighten the gullible hermiones hand was back in the air sir what exactly do you mean by the horror within the chamber that is believed to be some sort of monster which the heir of slytherin alone can control said professor binns in his dry reedy voice the class exchanged nervous looks i tell you the thing does not exist said professor binns shuffling his notes there is no chamber and no monster but sir said seamus finnigan if the chamber can only be opened by slytherins true heir no one else would be able to find it would they nonsense oflaherty said professor binns in an aggravated tone if a long succession of hogwarts headmasters and headmistresses havent found the thing but professor piped up parvati patil youd probably have to use dark magic to open it just because a wizard doesnt use dark magic doesnt mean he cant miss pennyfeather snapped professor binns i repeat if the likes of dumbledore but maybe youve got to be related to slytherin so dumbledore couldnt began dean thomas but professor binns had had enough that will do he said sharply it is a myth it does not exist there is not a shred of evidence that slytherin ever built so much as a secret broom cupboard i regret telling you such a foolish story we will return if you please to history to solid believable verifiable fact and within five minutes the class had sunk back into its usual torpor i always knew salazar slytherin was a twisted old loony ron told harry and hermione as they fought their way through the teeming corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner but i never knew he started all this pureblood stuff i wouldnt be in his house if you paid me honestly if the sorting hat had tried to put me in slytherin idve got the train straight back home hermione nodded fervently but harry didnt say anything his stomach had just dropped unpleasantly harry had never told ron and hermione that the sorting hat had seriously considered putting him in slytherin he could remember as though it were yesterday the small voice that had spoken in his ear when hed placed the hat on his head a year before you could be great you know its all here in your head and slytherin would help you on the way to greatness no doubt about that but harry who had already heard of slytherin houses reputation for turning out dark wizards had thought desperately not slytherin and the hat had said oh well if youre sure better be gryffindor as they were shunted along in the throng colin creevy went past hiya harry hullo colin said harry automatically harry harry a boy in my class has been saying youre but colin was so small he couldnt fight against the tide of people bearing him toward the great hall they heard him squeak see you harry and he was gone whats a boy in his class saying about you hermione wondered that im slytherins heir i expect said harry his stomach dropping another inch or so as he suddenly remembered the way justin finchfletchley had run away from him at lunchtime people herell believe anything said ron in disgust the crowd thinned and they were able to climb the next staircase without difficulty dyou really think theres a chamber of secrets ron asked hermione i dont know she said frowning dumbledore couldnt cure mrs norris and that makes me think that whatever attacked her might not be well human as she spoke they turned a corner and found themselves at the end of the very corridor where the attack had happened they stopped and looked the scene was just as it had been that night except that there was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket and an empty chair stood against the wall bearing the message the chamber of secrets has been opened thats where filch has been keeping guard ron muttered they looked at each other the corridor was deserted cant hurt to have a poke around said harry dropping his bag and getting to his hands and knees so that he could crawl along searching for clues scorch marks he said here and here come and look at this said hermione this is funny harry got up and crossed to the window next to the message on the wall hermione was pointing at the topmost pane where around twenty spiders were scuttling apparently fighting to get through a small crack a long silvery thread was dangling like a rope as though they had all climbed it in their hurry to get outside have you ever seen spiders act like that said hermione wonderingly no said harry have you ron ron he looked over his shoulder ron was standing well back and seemed to be fighting the impulse to run whats up said harry i dont like spiders said ron tensely i never knew that said hermione looking at ron in surprise youve used spiders in potions loads of times i dont mind them dead said ron who was carefully looking anywhere but at the window i just dont like the way they move hermione giggled its not funny said ron fiercely if you must know when i was three fred turned my my teddy bear into a great big fiithy spider because i broke his toy broomstick you wouldnt like them either if youd been holding your bear and suddenly it had too many legs and he broke off shuddering hermione was obviously still trying not to laugh feeling they had better get off the subject harry said remember all that water on the floor where did that come from someones mopped it up it was about here said ron recovering himself to walk a few paces past filchs chair and pointing level with this door he reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew his hand as though hed been burned whats the matter said harry cant go in there said ron gruffly thats a girls toilet oh ron there wont be anyone in there said hermione standing up and coming over thats moaning myrtles place come on lets have a look and ignoring the large out of order sign she opened the door it was the gloomiest most depressing bathroom harry had ever set foot in under a large cracked and spotted mirror were a row of chipped sinks the floor was damp and reflected the dull light given off by the stubs of a few candles burning low in their holders the wooden doors to the stalls were flaking and scratched and one of them was dangling off its hinges hermione put her fingers to her lips and set off toward the end stall when she reached it she said hello myrtle how are you harry and ron went to look moaning myrtle was floating above the tank of the toilet picking a spot on her chin this is a girls bathroom she said eyeing ron and harry suspiciously theyre not girls no hermione agreed i just wanted to show them how er nice it is in here she waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floor ask her if she saw anything harry mouthed at hermione what are you whispering said myrtle staring at him nothing said harry quickly we wanted to ask i wish people would stop talking behind my back said myrtle in a voice choked with tears i do have feelings you know even if i am dead myrtle no one wants to upset you said hermione harry only no one wants to upset me thats a good one howled myrtle my life was nothing but misery at this place and now people come along ruining my death we wanted to ask you if youve seen anything funny lately said hermione quickly because a cat was attacked right outside your front door on halloween did you see anyone near here that night said harry i wasnt paying attention said myrtle dramatically peeves upset me so much i came in here and tried to kill myself then of course i remembered that im that im already dead said ron helpfully myrtle gave a tragic sob rose up in the air turned over and dived headfirst into the toilet splashing water all over them and vanishing from sight although from the direction of her muffled sobs she had come to rest somewhere in the u bend harry and ron stood with their mouths open but hermione shrugged wearily and said honestly that was almost cheerful for myrtle come on lets go harry had barely closed the door on myrtles gurgling sobs when a loud voice made all three of them jump ron percy weasley had stopped dead at the head of the stairs prefect badge agleam an expression of complete shock on his face thats a girls bathroom he gasped what were you just having a look around ron shrugged clues you know percy swelled in a manner that reminded harry forcefully of mrs weasley get away from there perry said striding toward them and starting to bustle them along flapping his arms dont you care what this looks like coming back here while everyones at dinner why shouldnt we be here said ron hotly stopping short and glaring at percy listen we never laid a finger on that cat thats what i told ginny said percy fiercely but she still seems to think youre going to be expelled ive never seen her so upset crying her eyes out you might think of her all the first years are thoroughly overexcited by this business you dont care about ginny said ron whose ears were now reddening youre just worried im going to mess up your chances of being head boy five points from gryffindor percy said tersely fingering his prefect badge and i hope it teaches you a lesson no more detective work or ill write to mum and he strode off the back of his neck as red as rons ears harry ron and hermione chose seats as far as possible from percy in the common room that night ron was still in a very bad temper and kept blotting his charms homework when he reached absently for his wand to remove the smudges it ignited the parchment fuming almost as much as his homework ron slammed the standard book of spells grade 2 shut to harrys surprise hermione followed suit who can it be though she said in a quiet voice as though continuing a conversation they had just been having whod want to frighten all the squibs and muggleborns out of hogwarts lets think said ron in mock puzzlement who do we know who thinks muggleborns are scum he looked at hermione hermione looked back unconvinced if youre talking about malfoy of course i am said ron you heard him youll be next mudbloods come on youve only got to look at his foul rat face to know its him malfoy the heir of slytherin said hermione skeptically look at his family said harry closing his books too the whole lot of them have been in slytherin hes always boasting about it they could easily be slytherins descendants his fathers definitely evil enough they couldve had the key to the chamber of secrets for centuries said ron handing it down father to son well said hermione cautiously i suppose its possible but how do we prove it said harry darkly there might be a way said hermione slowly dropping her voice still further with a quick glance across the room at percy of course it would be difficult and dangerous very dangerous wed be breaking about fifty school rules i expect if in a month or so you feel like explaining you will let us know wont you said ron irritably all right said hermione coldly what wed need to do is to get inside the slytherin common room and ask malfoy a few questions without him realizing its us but thats impossible harry said as ron laughed no its not said hermione all wed need would be some polyjuice potion whats that said ron and harry together snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago dyou think weve got nothing better to do in potions than listen to snape muttered ron it transforms you into somebody else think about it we could change into three of the slytherins no one would know it was us malfoy would probably tell us anything hes probably boasting about it in the slytherin common room right now if only we could hear him this polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me said ron frowning what if we were stuck looking like three of the slytherins forever it wears off after a while said hermione waving her hand impatiently but getting hold of the recipe will be very difficult snape said it was in a book called moste potente potions and its bound to be in the restricted section of the library there was only one way to get out a book from the restricted section you needed a signed note of permission from a teacher hard to see why wed want the book really said ron if we werent going to try and make one of the potions i think said hermione that if we made it sound as though we were just interested in the theory we might stand a chance oh come on no teachers going to fall for that said ron theyd have to be really thick chapter ten the rogue bludger since the disastrous episode of the pixies professor lockhart had not brought live creatures to class instead he read passages from his books to them and sometimes reenacted some of the more dramatic bits he usually picked harry to help him with these reconstructions so far harry had been forced to play a simple transylvanian villager whom lockhart had cured of a babbling curse a yeti with a head cold and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything except lettuce since lockhart had dealt with him harry was hauled to the front of the class during their very next defense against the dark arts lesson this time acting a werewolf if he hadnt had a very good reason for keeping lockhart in a good mood he would have refused to do it nice loud howl harry exactly and then if youll believe it i pounced like this slammed him to the floor thus with one hand i managed to hold him down with my other i put my wand to his throat i then screwed up my remaining strength and performed the immensely complex homorphus charm he let out a piteous moan go on harry higher than that good the fur vanished the fangs shrank and he turned back into a man simple yet effective and another village will remember me forever as the hero who delivered them from the monthly terror of werewolf attacks the bell rang and lockhart got to his feet homework compose a poem about my defeat of the wagga wagga werewolf signed copies of magical me to the author of the best one the class began to leave harry returned to the back of the room where ron and hermione were waiting ready harry muttered wait till everyones gone said hermione nervously all right she approached lockharts desk a piece of paper clutched tightly in her hand harry and ron right behind her er professor lockhart hermione stammered i wanted to to get this book out of the library just for background reading she held out the piece of paper her hand shaking slightly but the thing is its in the restricted section of the library so i need a teacher to sign for it im sure it would help me understand what you say in gadding with ghouls about slowacting venoms ah gadding with ghouls said lockhart taking the note from hermione and smiling widely at her possibly my very favorite book you enjoyed it oh yes said hermione eagerly so clever the way you trapped that last one with the teastrainer well im sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the year a little extra help said lockhart warmly and he pulled out an enormous peacock quill yes nice isnt it he said misreading the revolted look on rons face i usually save it for booksignings he scrawled an enormous loopy signature on the note and handed it back to hermione so harry said lockhart while hermione folded the note with fumbling fingers and slipped it into her bag tomorrows the first quidditch match of the season i believe gryffindor against slytherin is it not i hear youre a useful player i was a seeker too i was asked to try for the national squad but preferred to dedicate my life to the eradication of the dark forces still if ever you feel the need for a little private training dont hesitate to ask always happy to pass on my expertise to less able players harry made an indistinct noise in his throat and then hurried off after ron and hermione i dont believe it he said as the three of them examined the signature on the note he didnt even look at the book we wanted thats because hes a brainless git said ron but who cares weve got what we needed he is not a brainless git said hermione shrilly as they half ran toward the library just because he said you were the best student of the year they dropped their voices as they entered the muffled stillness of the library madam pince the librarian was a thin irritable woman who looked like an underfed vulture moste potente potions she repeated suspiciously trying to take the note from hermione but hermione wouldnt let go i was wondering if i could keep it she said breathlessly oh come on said ron wrenching it from her grasp and thrusting it at madam pince well get you another autograph lockhartll sign anything if it stands still long enough madam pince held the note up to the light as though determined to detect a forgery but it passed the test she stalked away between the lofty shelves and returned several minutes later carrying a large and moldylooking book hermione put it carefully into her bag and they left trying not to walk too quickly or look too guilty five minutes later they were barricaded in moaning myrtles outoforder bathroom once again hermione had overridden rons objections by pointing out that it was the last place anyone in their right minds would go so they were guaranteed some privacy moaning myrtle was crying noisily in her stall but they were ignoring her and she them hermione opened moste potente potions carefully and the three of them bent over the dampspotted pages it was clear from a glance why it belonged in the restricted section some of the potions had effects almost too gruesome to think about and there were some very unpleasant illustrations which included a man who seemed to have been turned inside out and a witch sprouting several extra pairs of arms out of her head here it is said hermione excitedly as she found the page headed the polyjuice potion it was decorated with drawings of people halfway through transforming into other people harry sincerely hoped the artist had imagined the looks of intense pain on their faces this is the most complicated potion ive ever seen said hermione as they scanned the recipe lacewing flies leeches fluxweed and knotgrass she murmured running her finger down the list of ingredients well theyre easy enough theyre in the student storecupboard we can help ourselves oooh look powdered horn of a bicorn dont know where were going to get that shredded skin of a boomslang thatll be tricky too and of course a bit of whoever we want to change into excuse me said ron sharply what dyou mean a bit of whoever were changing into im drinking nothing with crabbes toenails in it hermione continued as though she hadnt heard him we dont have to worry about that yet though because we add those bits last ron turned speechless to harry who had another worry dyou realize how much were going to have to steal hermione shredded skin of a boomslang thats definitely not in the students cupboard whatre we going to do break into snapes private stores i dont know if this is a good idea hermione shut the book with a snap well if you two are going to chicken out fine she said there were bright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter than usual i dont want to break rules you know i think threatening muggleborns is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion but if you dont want to find out if its malfoy ill go straight to madam pince now and hand the book back in i never thought id see the day when youd be persuading us to break rules said ron all right well do it but not toenails okay how long will it take to make anyway said harry as hermione looking happier opened the book again well since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon and the lacewings have got to be stewed for twentyone days id say itd be ready in about a month if we can get all the ingredients a month said ron malfoy could have attacked half the muggleborns in the school by then but hermiones eyes narrowed dangerously again and he added swiftly but its the best plan weve got so full steam ahead i say however while hermione was checking that the coast was clear for them to leave the bathroom ron muttered to harry itll be a lot less hassle if you can just knock malfoy off his broom tomorrow harry woke early on saturday morning and lay for a while thinking about the coming quidditch match he was nervous mainly at the thought of what wood would say if gryffindor lost but also at the idea of facing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms gold could buy he had never wanted to beat slytherin so badly after half an hour of lying there with his insides churning he got up dressed and went down to breakfast early where he found the rest of the gryffindor team huddled at the long empty table all looking uptight and not speaking much as eleven oclock approached the whole school started to make its way down to the quidditch stadium it was a muggy sort of day with a hint of thunder in the air ron and hermione came hurrying over to wish harry good luck as he entered the locker rooms the team pulled on their scarlet gryffindor robes then sat down to listen to woods usual prematch pep talk slytherin has better brooms than us he began no point denying it but weve got better people on our brooms weve trained harder than they have weve been flying in all weathers too true muttered george weasley i havent been properly dry since august and were going to make them rue the day they let that little bit of slime malfoy buy his way onto their team chest heaving with emotion wood turned to harry itll be down to you harry to show them that a seeker has to have something more than a rich father get to that snitch before malfoy or die trying harry because weve got to win today weve got to so no pressure harry said fred winking at him as they walked out onto the pitch a roar of noise greeted them mainly cheers because ravenclaw and hufflepuff were anxious to see slytherin beaten but the slytherins in the crowd made their boos and hisses heard too madam hooch the quidditch teacher asked flint and wood to shake hands which they did giving each other threatening stares and gripping rather harder than was necessary on my whistle said madam hooch three two one with a roar from the crowd to speed them upward the fourteen players rose toward the leaden sky harry flew higher than any of them squinting around for the snitch all right there scarhead yelled malfoy shooting underneath him as though to show off the speed of his broom harry had no time to reply at that very moment a heavy black bludger came pelting toward him he avoided it so narrowly that he felt it ruffle his hair as it passed close one harry said george streaking past him with his club in his hand ready to knock the bludger back toward a slytherin harry saw george give the bludger a powerful whack in the direction of adrian pucey but the bludger changed direction in midair and shot straight for harry again harry dropped quickly to avoid it and george managed to hit it hard toward malfoy once again the bludger swerved like a boomerang and shot at harrys head harry put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the other end of the pitch he could hear the bludger whistling along behind him what was going on bludgers never concentrated on one player like this it was their job to try and unseat as many people as possible fred weasley was waiting for the bludger at the other end harry ducked as fred swung at the bludger with all his might the bludger was knocked off course gotcha fred yelled happily but he was wrong as though it was magnetically attracted to harry the bludger pelted after him once more and harry was forced to fly off at full speed it had started to rain harry felt heavy drops fall onto his face splattering onto his glasses he didnt have a clue what was going on in the rest of the game until he heard lee jordan who was commentating say slytherin lead sixty points to zero the slytherins superior brooms were clearly doing their jobs and meanwhile the mad bludger was doing all it could to knock harry out of the air fred and george were now flying so close to him on either side that harry could see nothing at all except their flailing arms and had no chance to look for the snitch let alone catch it someones tampered with this bludger fred grunted swinging his bat with all his might at it as it launched a new attack on harry we need time out said george trying to signal to wood and stop the bludger breaking harrys nose at the same time wood had obviously got the message madam hoochs whistle rang out and harry fred and george dived for the ground still trying to avoid the mad bludger whats going on said wood as the gryffindor team huddled together while slytherins in the crowd jeered were being flattened fred george where were you when that bludger stopped angelina scoring we were twenty feet above her stopping the other bludger from murdering harry oliver said george angrily someones fixed it it wont leave harry alone it hasnt gone for anyone else all game the slytherins must have done something to it but the bludgers have been locked in madam hoochs office since our last practice and there was nothing wrong with them then said wood anxiously madam hooch was walking toward them over her shoulder harry could see the slytherin team jeering and pointing in his direction listen said harry as she came nearer and nearer with you two flying around me all the time the only way im going to catch the snitch is if it flies up my sleeve go back to the rest of the team and let me deal with the rogue one dont be thick said fred itll take your head off wood was looking from harry to the weasleys oliver this is insane said alicia spinner angrily you cant let harry deal with that thing on his own lets ask for an inquiry if we stop now well have to forfeit the match said harry and were not losing to slytherin just because of a crazy bludger come on oliver tell them to leave me alone this is all your fault george said angrily to wood get the snitch or die trying what a stupid thing to tell him madam hooch had joined them ready to resume play she asked wood wood looked at the determined look on harrys face all right he said fred george you heard harry leave him alone and let him deal with the bludger on his own the rain was falling more heavily now on madam hoochs whistle harry kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of the bludger behind him higher and higher harry climbed he looped and swooped spiraled zigzagged and rolled slightly dizzy he nevertheless kept his eyes wide open rain was speckling his glasses and ran up his nostrils as he hung upside down avoiding another fierce dive from the bludger he could hear laughter from the crowd he knew he must look very stupid but the rogue bludger was heavy and couldnt change direction as quickly as harry could he began a kind of rollercoaster ride around the edges of the stadium squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the gryffindor goal posts where adrian pucey was trying to get past wood a whistling in harrys ear told him the bludger had just missed him again he turned right over and sped in the opposite direction training for the ballet potter yelled malfoy as harry was forced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the bludger and he fled the bludger trailing a few feet behind him and then glaring back at malfoy in hatred he saw it the golden snitch it was hovering inches above malfoys left ear and malfoy busy laughing at harry hadnt seen it for an agonizing moment harry hung in midair not daring to speed toward malfoy in case he looked up and saw the snitch wham he had stayed still a second too long the bludger had hit him at last smashed into his elbow and harry felt his arm break dimly dazed by the searing pain in his arm he slid sideways on his raindrenched broom one knee still crooked over it his right arm dangling useless at his side the bludger came pelting back for a second attack this time wming at his face harry swerved out of the way one idea firmly lodged in his numb brain get to malfoy through a haze of rain and pain he dived for the shimmering sneering face below him and saw its eyes widen with fear malfoy thought harry was attacking him what the he gasped careening out of harrys way harry took his remaining hand off his broom and made a wild snatch he felt his fingers close on the cold snitch but was now only gripping the broom with his legs and there was a yell from the crowd below as he headed straight for the ground trying hard not to pass out with a splattering thud he hit the mud and rolled off his broom his arm was hanging at a very strange angle riddled with pain he heard as though from a distance a good deal of whistling and shouting he focused on the snitch clutched in his good hand aha he said vaguely weve won and he fainted he came around rain falling on his face still lying on the field with someone leaning over him he saw a glitter of teeth oh no not you he moaned doesnt know what hes saying said lockhart loudly to the anxious crowd of gryffindors pressing around them not to worry harry im about to fix your arm nosaid harry ill keep it like this thanks he tried to sit up but the pain was terrible he heard a familiar clicking noise nearby i dont want a photo of this colin he said loudly lie back harry said lockhart soothingly its a simple charm ive used countless times why cant i just go to the hospital wing said harry through clenched teeth he should really professor said a muddy wood who couldnt help grinning even though his seeker was injured great capture harry really spectacular your best yet id say through the thicket of legs around him harry spotted fred and george weasley wrestling the rogue bludger into a box it was still putting up a terrific fight stand back said lockhart who was rolling up his jadegreen sleeves no dont said harry weakly but lockhart was twirling his wand and a second later had directed it straight at harrys arm a strange and unpleasant sensation started at harrys shoulder and spread all the way down to his fingertips it felt as though his arm was being deflated he didnt dare look at what was happening he had shut his eyes his face turned away from his arm but his worst fears were realized as the people above him gasped and colin creevey began clicking away madly his arm didnt hurt anymore nor did it feel remotely like an arm ah said lockhart yes well that can sometimes happen but the point is the bones are no longer broken thats the thing to bear in mind so harry just toddle up to the hospital wing ah mr weasley miss granger would you escort him and madam pomfrey will be able to er tidy you up a bit as harry got to his feet he felt strangely lopsided taking a deep breath he looked down at his right side what he saw nearly made him pass out again poking out of the end of his robes was what looked like a thick flesh colored rubber glove he tried to move his fingers nothing happened lockhart hadnt mended harrys bones he had removed them madam pomfrey wasnt at all pleased you should have come straight to me she raged holding up the sad limp remainder of what half an hour before had been a working arm i can mend bones in a second but growing them back you will be able to wont you said harry desperately ill be able to certainly but it will be painful said madam pomfrey grimly throwing harry a pair of pajamas youll have to stay the night hermione waited outside the curtain drawn around harrys bed while ron helped him into his pajamas it took a while to stuff the rubbery boneless arm into a sleeve how can you stick up for lockhart now hermione eh ron called through the curtain as he pulled harrys limp fingers through the cuff if harry had wanted deboning he would have asked anyone can make a mistake said hermione and it doesnt hurt anymore does it harry no said harry getting into bed but it doesnt do anything else either as he swung himself onto the bed his arm flapped pointlessly hermione and madam pomfrey came around the curtain madam pomfrey was holding a large bottle of something labeled skelegro youre in for a rough night she said pouring out a steaming beakerful and handing it to him regrowing bones is a nasty business so was taking the skelegro it burned harrys mouth and throat as it went down making him cough and splutter still tuttutting about dangerous sports and inept teachers madam pomfrey re treated leaving ron and hermione to help harry gulp down some water we won though said ron a grin breaking across his face that was some catch you made malfoys face he looked ready to kill i want to know how he fixed that bludger said hermione darkly we can add that to the list of questions well ask him when weve taken the polyjuice potion said harry sinking back onto his pillows i hope it tastes better than this stuff if its got bits of slytherins in it youve got to be joking said ron the door of the hospital wing burst open at that moment filthy and soaking wet the rest of the gryffindor team had arrived to see harry unbelievable flying harry said george ive just seen marcus flint yelling at malfoy something about having the snitch on top of his head and not noticing malfoy didnt seem too happy they had brought cakes sweets and bottles of pumpkin juice they gathered around harrys bed and were just getting started on what promised to be a good party when madam pomfrey came storming over shouting this boy needs rest hes got thirtythree bones to regrow out out and harry was left alone with nothing to distract him from the stabbing pains in his limp arm hours and hours later harry woke quite suddenly in the pitch blackness and gave a small yelp of pain his arm now felt full of large splinters for a second he thought that was what had woken him then with a thrill of horror he realized that someone was sponging his forehead in the dark get off he said loudly and then dobby the houseelfs goggling tennis ball eyes were peering at harry through the darkness a single tear was running down his long pointed nose harry potter came back to school he whispered miserably dobby warned and warned harry potter ah sir why didnt you heed dobby why didnt harry potter go back home when he missed the train harry heaved himself up on his pillows and pushed dobbys sponge away whatre you doing here he said and how did you know i missed the train dobbys lip trembled and harry was seized by a sudden suspicion it was you he said slowly you stopped the barrier from letting us through indeed yes sir said dobby nodding his head vigorously ears flapping dobby hid and watched for harry potter and sealed the gateway and dobby had to iron his hands afterward he showed harry ten long bandaged fingers but dobby didnt care sir for he thought harry potter was safe and never did dobby dream that harry potter would get to school another way he was rocking backward and forward shaking his ugly head dobby was so shocked when he heard harry potter was back at hogwarts he let his masters dinner burn such a flogging dobby never had sir harry slumped back onto his pillows you nearly got ron and me expelled he said fiercely youd better get lost before my bones come back dobby or i might strangle you dobby smiled weakly dobby is used to death threats sir dobby gets them five times a day at home he blew his nose on a corner of the filthy pillowcase he wore looking so pathetic that harry felt his anger ebb away in spite of himself why dyou wear that thing dobby he asked curiously this sir said dobby plucking at the pillowcase tis a mark of the houseelfs enslavement sir dobby can only be freed if his masters present him with clothes sir the family is careful not to pass dobby even a sock sir for then he would be free to leave their house forever dobby mopped his bulging eyes and said suddenly harry potter must go home dobby thought his bludger would be enough to make your bludger said harry anger rising once more what dyou mean your bludger you made that bludger try and kill me not kill you sir never kill you said dobby shocked dobby wants to save harry potters life better sent home grievously injured than remain here sir dobby only wanted harry potter hurt enough to be sent home oh is that all said harry angrily i dont suppose youre going to tell me why you wanted me sent home in pieces ah if harry potter only knew dobby groaned more tears dripping onto his ragged pillowcase if he knew what he means to us to the lowly the enslaved we dregs of the magical world dobby remembers how it was when hewho mustnotbenamed was at the height of his powers sir we houseelfs were treated like vermin sir of course dobby is still treated like that sir he admitted drying his face on the pillowcase but mostly sir life has improved for my kind since you triumphed over hewhomustnotbenamed harry potter survived and the dark lords power was broken and it was a new dawn sir and harry potter shone like a beacon of hope for those of us who thought the dark days would never end sit and now at hogwarts terrible things are to happen are perhaps happening already and dobby cannot let harry potter stay here now that history is to repeat itself now that the chamber of secrets is open once more dobby froze horrorstruck then grabbed harrys water jug from his bedside table and cracked it over his own head toppling out of sight a second later he crawled back onto the bed crosseyed muttering bad dobby very bad dobby so there is a chamber of secrets harry whispered and did you say its been opened before tell me dobby he seized the elfs bony wrist as dobbys hand inched toward the water jug but im not muggleborn how can i be in danger from the chamber ah sir ask no more ask no more of poor dobby stammered the elf his eyes huge in the dark dark deeds are planned in this place but harry potter must not be here when they happen go home harry potter go home harry potter must not meddle in this sir tis too dangerous who is it dobby harry said keeping a firm hold on dobbys wrist to stop him from hitting himself with the water jug again whos opened it who opened it last time dobby cant sir dobby cant dobby mustnt tell squealed the elf go home harry potter go home im not going anywhere said harry fiercely one of my best friends is muggleborn shell be first in line if the chamber really has been opened harry potter risks his own life for his friends moaned dobby in a kind of miserable ecstasy so noble so valiant but he must save himself he must harry potter must not dobby suddenly froze his bat ears quivering harry heard it too there were footsteps coming down the passageway outside dobby must go breathed the elf terrified there was a loud crack and harrys fist was suddenly clenched on thin air he slumped back into bed his eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as the footsteps drew nearer next moment dumbledore was backing into the dormitory wearing a long woolly dressing gown and a nightcap he was carrying one end of what looked like a statue professor mcgonagall appeared a second later carrying its feet together they heaved it onto a bed get madam pomfrey whispered dumbledore and professor mcgonagall hurried past the end of harrys bed out of sight harry lay quite still pretending to be asleep he heard urgent voices and then professor mcgonagall swept back into view closely followed by madam pomfrey who was pulling a cardigan on over her nightdress he heard a sharp intake of breath what happened madam pomfrey whispered to dumbledore bending over the statue on the bed another attack said dumbledore minerva found him on the stairs there was a bunch of grapes next to him said professor mcgonagall we think he was trying to sneak up here to visit potter harrys stomach gave a horrible lurch slowly and carefully he raised himself a few inches so he could look at the statue on the bed a ray of moonlight lay across its staring face it was colin creevey his eyes were wide and his hands were stuck up in front of him holding his camera petrified whispered madam pomfrey yes said professor mcgonagall but i shudder to think if albus hadnt been on the way downstairs for hot chocolate who knows what might have the three of them stared down at colin then dumbledore leaned forward and wrenched the camera out of colins rigid grip you dont think he managed to get a picture of his attacker said professor mcgonagall eagerly dumbledore didnt answer he opened the back of the camera good gracious said madam pomfrey a jet of steam had hissed out of the camera harry three beds away caught the acrid smell of burnt plastic melted said madam pomfrey wonderingly all melted what does this mean albus professor mcgonagall asked urgently it means said dumbledore that the chamber of secrets is indeed open again madam pomfrey clapped a hand to her mouth professor mcgonagall stared at dumbledore but albus surely who the question is not who said dumbledore his eyes on colin the question is how and from what harry could see of professor mcgonagalls shadowy face she didnt understand this any better than he did chapter eleven the dueling club harry woke up on sunday morning to find the dormitory blazing with winter sunlight and his arm reboned but very stiff he sat up quickly and looked over at colins bed but it had been blocked from view by the high curtains harry had changed behind yesterday seeing that he was awake madam pomfrey came bustling over with a breakfast tray and then began bending and stretching his arm and fingers all in order she said as he clumsily fed himself porridge lefthanded when youve finished eating you may leave harry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off to gryffindor tower desperate to tell ron and hermione about colin and dobby but they werent there harry left to look for them wondering where they could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that they werent interested in whether he had his bones back or not as harry passed the library percy weasley strolled out of it looking in far better spirits than last time theyd met oh hello harry he said excellent flying yesterday really excellent gryffindor has just taken the lead for the house cup you earned fifty points you havent seen ron or hermione have you said harry no i havent said percy his smile fading i hope rons not in another girls toilet harry forced a laugh watched percy walk out of sight and then headed straight for moaning myrtles bathroom he couldnt see why ron and hermione would be in there again but after making sure that neither filch nor any prefects were around he opened the door and heard their voices coming from a locked stall its me he said closing the door behind him there was a clunk a splash and a gasp from within the stall and he saw hermiones eye peering through the keyhole harry she said you gave us such a fright come in hows your arm fine said harry squeezing into the stall an old cauldron was perched on the toilet and a crackling from under the rim told harry they had lit a fire beneath it conjuring up portable waterproof fires was a speciality of hermiones wedve come to meet you but we decided to get started on the polyjuice potion ron explained as harry with difficulty locked the stall again weve decided this is the safest place to hide it harry started to tell them about colin but hermione interrupted we already know we heard professor mcgonagall telling professor flitwick this morning thats why we decided wed better get going the sooner we get a confession out of malfoy the better snarled ron dyou know what i think he was in such a foul temper after the quidditch match he took it out on colin theres something else said harry watching hermione tearing bundles of knotgrass and throwing them into the potion dobby came to visit me in the middle of the night ron and hermione looked up amazed harry told them everything dobby had told him or hadnt told him hermione and ron listened with their mouths open the chamber of secrets has been opened before hermione said this settles it said ron in a triumphant voice lucius malfoy mustve opened the chamber when he was at school here and now hes told dear old draco how to do it its obvious wish dobbyd told you what kind of monsters in there though i want to know how come nobodys noticed it sneaking around the school maybe it can make itself invisible said hermione prodding leeches to the bottom of the cauldron or maybe it can disguise itself pretend to be a suit of armor or something ive read about chameleon ghouls you read too much hermione said ron pouring dead lacewings on top of the leeches he crumpled up the empty lacewing bag and looked at harry so dobby stopped us from getting on the train and broke your arm he shook his head you know what harry if he doesnt stop trying to save your life hes going to kill you the news that colin creevey had been attacked and was now lying as though dead in the hospital wing had spread through the entire school by monday morning the air was suddenly thick with rumor and suspicion the first years were now moving around the castle in tightknit groups as though scared they would be attacked if they ventured forth alone ginny weasley who sat next to colin creevey in charms was distraught but harry felt that fred and george were going the wrong way about cheering her up they were taking turns covering themselves with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behind statues they only stopped when percy apoplectic with rage told them he was going to write to mrs weasley and tell her ginny was having nightmares meanwhile hidden from the teachers a roaring trade in talismans amulets and other protective devices was sweeping the school neville longbottom bought a large evilsmelling green onion a pointed purple crystal and a rotting newt tail before the other gryffindor boys pointed out that he was in no danger he was a pureblood and therefore unlikely to be attacked they went for filch first neville said his round face fearful and everyone knows im almost a squib in the second week of december professor mcgonagall came around as usual collecting names of those who would be staying at school for christmas harry ron and hermione signed her list they had heard that malfoy was staying which struck them as very suspicious the holidays would be the perfect time to use the polyjuice potion and try to worm a confession out of him unfortunately the potion was only half finished they still needed the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin and the only place they were going to get them was from snapes private stores harry privately felt hed rather face slytherins legendary monster than letsnape catch him robbing his office what we need said hermione briskly as thursday afternoons double potions lesson loomed nearer is a diversion then one of us can sneak into snapes office and take what we need harry and ron looked at her nervously i think id better do the actual stealing hermione continued in a matter offact tone you two will be expelled if you get into any more trouble and ive got a clean record so all you need to do is cause enough mayhem to keep snape busy for five minutes or so harry smiled feebly deliberately causing mayhem in snapes potions class was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons thursday afternoons lesson proceeded in the usual way twenty cauldrons stood steaming between the wooden desks on which stood brass scales and jars of ingredients snape prowled through the fumes making waspish remarks about the gryffindors work while the slytherins sniggered appreciatively draco malfoy who was snapes favorite student kept flicking pufferfish eyes at ron and harry who knew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than you could say unfair harrys swelling solution was far too runny but he had his mind on more important things he was waiting for hermiones signal and he hardly listened as snape paused to sneer at his watery potion when snape turned and walked off to bully neville hermione caught harrys eye and nodded harry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron pulled one of freds filibuster fireworks out of his pocket and gave it a quick prod with his wand the firework began to fizz and sputter knowing he had only seconds harry straightened up took aim and lobbed it into the air it landed right on target in goyles cauldron goyles potion exploded showering the whole class people shrieked as splashes of the swelling solution hit them malfoy got a faceful and his nose began to swell like a balloon goyle blundered around his hands over his eyes which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate snape was trying to restore calm and find out what had happened through the confusion harry saw hermione slip quietly into snapes office silence silence snape roared anyone who has been splashed come here for a deflating draft when i find out who did this harry tried not to laugh as he watched malfoy hurry forward his head drooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon as half the class lumbered up to snapes desk some weighted down with arms like clubs others unable to talk through gigantic puffedup lips harry saw hermione slide back into the dungeon the front of her robes bulging when everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellings had subsided snape swept over to goyles cauldron and scooped out the twisted black remains of the firework there was a sudden hush if i ever find out who threw this snape whispered i shall make sure that person is expelled harry arranged his face into what he hoped was a puzzled expression snape was looking right at him and the bell that rang ten minutes later could not have been more welcome he knew it was me harry told ron and hermione as they hurried back to moaning myrtles bathroom i could tell hermione threw the new ingredients into the cauldron and began to stir feverishly itll be ready in two weeks she said happily snape cant prove it was you said ron reassuringly to harry what can he do knowing snape something foul said harry as the potion frothed and bubbled a week later harry ron and hermione were walking across the entrance hall when they saw a small knot of people gathered around the notice board reading a piece of parchment that had just been pinned up seamus finnigan and dean thomas beckoned them over looking excited theyre starting a dueling club said seamus first meeting tonight i wouldnt mind dueling lessons they might come in handy one of these days what you reckon slytherins monster can duel said ron but he too read the sign with interest could be useful he said to harry and hermione as they went into dinner shall we go harry and hermione were all for it so at eight oclock that evening they hurried back to the great hall the long dining tables had vanished and a golden stage had appeared along one wall lit by thousands of candles floating overhead the ceiling was velvety black once more and most of the school seemed to be packed beneath it all carrying their wands and looking excited i wonder wholl be teaching us said hermione as they edged into the chattering crowd someone told me flitwick was a dueling champion when he was young maybe itll be him as long as its not harry began but he ended on a groan gilderoy lockhart was walking onto the stage resplendent in robes of deep plum and accompanied by none other than snape wearing his usual black lockhart waved an arm for silence and called gather round gather round can everyone see me can you all hear me excellent now professor dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little dueling club to train you all in case you ever need to defend yourselves as i myself have done on countless occasions for full details see my published works let me introduce my assistant professor snape said lockhart flashing a wide smile he tells me he knows a tiny little bit about dueling himself and has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration before we begin now i dont want any of you youngsters to worry youll still have your potions master when im through with him never fear wouldnt it be good if they finished each other off ron muttered in harrys ear snapes upper lip was curling harry wondered why lockhart was still smiling if snape had been looking at him like that hed have been running as fast as he could in the opposite direction lockhart and snape turned to face each other and bowed at least lockhart did with much twirling of his hands whereas snape jerked his head irritably then they raised their wands like swords in front of them as you see we are holding our wands in the accepted combative position lockhart told the silent crowd on the count of three we will cast our first spells neither of us will be aiming to kill of course i wouldnt bet on that harry murmured watching snape baring his teeth one two three both of them swung their wands above their heads and pointed them at their opponent snape cried expelliarmus there was a dazzling flash of scarlet light and lockhart was blasted off his feet he flew backward off the stage smashed into the wall and slid down it to sprawl on the floor malfoy and some of the other slytherins cheered hermione was dancing on tiptoes do you think hes all right she squealed through her fingers who cares said harry and ron together lockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet his hat had fallen off and his wavy hair was standing on end well there you have it he said tottering back onto the platform that was a disarming charm as you see ive lost my wand ah thank you miss brown yes an excellent idea to show them that professor snape but if you dont mind my saying so it was very obvious what you were about to do if i had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy however i felt it would be instructive to let them see snape was looking murderous possibly lockhart had noticed because he said enough demonstrating im going to come amongst you now and put you all into pairs professor snape if youd like to help me they moved through the crowd matching up partners lockhart teamed neville with justin finchfletchley but snape reached harry and ron first time to split up the dream team i think he sneered weasley you can partner finnigan potter harry moved automatically toward hermione i dont think so said snape smiling coldly mr malfoy come over here lets see what you make of the famous potter and you miss granger you can partner miss bulstrode malfoy strutted over smirking behind him walked a slytherin girl who reminded harry of a picture hed seen in holidays with hags she was large and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively hermione gave her a weak smile that she did not return face your partners called lockhart back on the platform and bow harry and malfoy barely inclined their heads not taking their eyes off each other wands at the ready shouted lockhart when i count to three cast your charms to disarm your opponents only to disarm them we dont want any accidents one two three harry swung his wand high but malfoy had already started on two his spell hit harry so hard he felt as though hed been hit over the head with a saucepan he stumbled but everything still seemed to be working and wasting no more time harry pointed his wand straight at malfoy and shouted rictusempra a jet of silver light hit malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up wheezing i said disarm only lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of the battling crowd as malfoy sank to his knees harry had hit him with a tickling charm and he could barely move for laughing harry hung back with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch malfoy while he was on the floor but this was a mistake gasping for breath malfoy pointed his wand at harrys knees choked tarantallegra and the next second harrys legs began to jerk around out of his control in a kind of quickstep stop stop screamed lockhart but snape took charge finite incantatem he shouted harrys feet stopped dancing malfoy stopped laughing and they were able to look up a haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the scene both neville and justin were lying on the floor panting ron was holding up an ashenfaced seamus apologizing for whatever his broken wand had done but hermione and millicent bulstrode were still moving millicent had hermione in a headlock and hermione was whimpering in pain both their wands lay forgotten on the floor harry leapt forward and pulled millicent off it was difficult she was a lot bigger than he was dear dear said lockhart skittering through the crowd looking at the aftermath of the duels up you go macmillan careful there miss fawcett pinch it hard itll stop bleeding in a second boot i think id better teach you how to block unfriendly spells said lockhart standing flustered in the midst of the hall he glanced at snape whose black eyes glinted and looked quickly away lets have a volunteer pair longbottom and finchfletchley how about you a bad idea professor lockhart said snape gliding over like a large and malevolent bat longbottom causes devastation with the simplest spells well be sending whats left of finchfletchley up to the hospital wing in a matchbox nevilles round pink face went pinker how about malfoy and potter said snape with a twisted smile excellent idea said lockhart gesturing harry and malfoy into the middle of the hall as the crowd backed away to give them room now harry said lockhart when draco points his wand at you you do this he raised his own wand attempted a complicated sort of wiggling action and dropped it snape smirked as lockhart quickly picked it up saying whoops my wand is a little overexcited snape moved closer to malfoy bent down and whispered something in his ear malfoy smirked too harry looked up nervously at lockhart and said professor could you show me that blocking thing again scared muttered malfoy so that lockhart couldnt hear him you wish said harry out of the corner of his mouth lockhart cuffed harry merrily on the shoulder just do what i did harry what drop my wand but lockhart wasnt listening three two one go he shouted malfoy raised his wand quickly and bellowed serpensortia the end of his wand exploded harry watched aghast as a long black snake shot out of it fell heavily onto the floor between them and raised itself ready to strike there were screams as the crowd backed swiftly away clearing the floor dont move potter said snape lazily clearly enjoying the sight of harry standing motionless eye to eye with the angry snake ill get rid of it allow me shouted lockhart he brandished his wand at the snake and there was a loud bang the snake instead of vanishing flew ten feet into the air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack enraged hissing furiously it slithered straight toward justin finchfletchley and raised itself again fangs exposed poised to strike harry wasnt sure what made him do it he wasnt even aware of deciding to do it all he knew was that his legs were carrying him forward as though he was on casters and that he had shouted stupidly at the snake leave him alone and miraculously inexplicably the snake slumped to the floor docile as a thick black garden hose its eyes now on harry harry felt the fear drain out of him he knew the snake wouldnt attack anyone now though how he knew it he couldnt have explained he looked up at justin grinning expecting to see justin looking relieved or puzzled or even grateful but certainly not angry and scared what do you think youre playing at he shouted and before harry could say anything justin had turned and stormed out of the hall snape stepped forward waved his wand and the snake vanished in a small puff of black smoke snape too was looking at harry in an unexpected way it was a shrewd and calculating look and harry didnt like it he was also dimly aware of an ominous muttering all around the walls then he felt a tugging on the back of his robes come on said rods voice in his ear move come on ron steered him out of the hall hermione hurrying alongside them as they went through the doors the people on either side drew away as though they were frightened of catching something harry didnt have a clue what was going on and neither ron nor hermione explained anything until they had dragged him all the way up to the empty gryffindor common room then ron pushed harry into an armchair and said youre a parselmouth why didnt you tell us im a what said harry a parselmouth said ron you can talk to snakes i know said harry i mean thats only the second time ive ever done it i accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin dudley at the zoo once long story but it was telling me it had never seen brazil and i sort of set it free without meaning to that was before i knew i was a wizard a boa constrictor told you it had never seen brazil ron repeated faintly so said harry i bet loads of people here can do it oh no they cant said ron its not a very common gift harry this is bad whats bad said harry starting to feel quite angry whats wrong with everyone listen if i hadnt told that snake not to attack justin oh thats what you said to it what dyou mean you were there you heard me i heard you speaking parseltongue said ron snake language you could have been saying anything no wonder justin panicked you sounded like you were egging the snake on or something it was creepy you know harry gaped at him i spoke a different language but i didnt realize how can i speak a language without knowing i can speak it ron shook his head both he and hermione were looking as though someone had died harry couldnt see what was so terrible dyou want to tell me whats wrong with stopping a massive snake biting off justins head he said what does it matter how i did it as long as justin doesnt have to join the headless hunt it matters said hermione speaking at last in a hushed voice because being able to talk to snakes was what salazar slytherin was famous for thats why the symbol of slytherin house is a serpent harrys mouth fell open exactly said ron and now the whole schools going to think youre his greatgreatgreatgreatgrandson or something but im not said harry with a panic he couldnt quite explain youll find that hard to prove said hermione he lived about a thousand years ago for all we know you could be harry lay awake for hours that night through a gap in the curtains around his fourposter he watched snow starting to drift past the tower window and wondered could he be a descendant of salazar slithering he didnt know anything about his fathers family after all the dursleys had always forbidden questions about his wizarding relatives quietly harry tried to say something in parseltongue the words wouldnt come it seemed he had to be facetoface with a snake to do it but im in gryffindor harry thought the sorting hat wouldnt have put me in here if i had slytherin blood ah said a nasty little voice in his brain but the sorting hat wanted to put you in slytherin dont you remember harry turned over hed see justin the next day in herbology and hed explain that hed been calling the snake off not egging it on which he thought angrily pummeling his pillow any fool should have realized by next morning however the snow that had begun in the night had turned into a blizzard so thick that the last herbology lesson of the term was canceled professor sprout wanted to fit socks and scarves on the mandrakes a tricky operation she would entrust to no one else now that it was so important for the mandrakes to grow quickly and revive mrs norris and colin creevey harry fretted about this next to the fire in the gryffindor common room while ron and hermione used their time off to play a game of wizard chess for heavens sake harry said hermione exasperated as one of rons bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged him off the board go and find justin if its so important to you so harry got up and left through the portrait hole wondering where justin might be the castle was darker than it usually was in daytime because of the thick swirling gray snow at every window shivering harry walked past classrooms where lessons were taking place catching snatches of what was happening within professor mcgonagall was shouting at someone who by the sound of it had turned his friend into a badger resisting the urge to take a look harry walked on by thinking that justin might be using his free time to catch up on some work and deciding to check the library first a group of the hufliepuffs who should have been in herbology were indeed sitting at the back of the library but they didnt seem to be working between the long lines of high bookshelves harry could see that their heads were close together and they were having what looked like an absorbing conversation he couldnt see whether justin was among them he was walking toward them when something of what they were saying met his ears and he paused to listen hidden in the invisibility section so anyway a stout boy was saying i told justin to hide up in our dormitory i mean to say if potters marked him down as his next victim its best if he keeps a low profile for a while of course justins been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to potter he was muggleborn justin actually told him hed been down for eton thats not the kind of thing you bandy about with slytherins heir on the loose is it you definitely think it is potter then ernie said a girl with blonde pigtails anxiously hannah said the stout boy solemnly hes a parselmouth everyone knows thats the mark of a dark wizard have you ever heard of a decent one who could talk to snakes they called slytherin himself serpenttongue there was some heavy murmuring at this and ernie went on remember what was written on the wall enemies of the heir beware potter had some sort of runin with filch next thing we know flichs cats attacked that first year creevey was annoying potter at the quidditch match taking pictures of him while he was lying in the mud next thing we know creeveys been attacked he always seems so nice though said hannah uncertainly and well hes the one who made youknowwho disappear he cant be all bad can he ernie lowered his voice mysteriously the hufflepuffs bent closer and harry edged nearer so that he could catch ernies words no one knows how he survived that attack by youknowwho i mean to say he was only a baby when it happened he should have been blasted into smithereens only a really powerful dark wizard could have survived a curse like that he dropped his voice until it was barely more than a whisper and said thats probably why youknowwho wanted to kill him in the first place didnt want another dark lord competing with him i wonder what other powers potters been hiding harry couldnt take anymore clearing his throat loudly he stepped out from behind the bookshelves if he hadnt been feeling so angry he would have found the sight that greeted him funny every one of the hufflepuffs looked as though they had been petrified by the sight of him and the color was draining out of ernies face hello said harry im looking for justin finchfletchley the hufepuffs worst fears had clearly been confirmed they all looked fearfully at ernie what do you want with him said ernie in a quavering voice i wanted to tell him what really happened with that snake at the dueling club said harry ernie bit his white lips and then taking a deep breath said we were all there we saw what happened then you noticed that after i spoke to it the snake backed off said harry all i saw said ernie stubbornly though he was trembling as he spoke was you speaking parseltongue and chasing the snake toward justin i didnt chase it at him harry said his voice shaking with anger it didnt even touch him it was a very near miss said ernie and in case youre getting ideas he added hastily i might tell you that you can trace my family back through nine generations of witches and warlocks and my bloods as pure as anyones so i dont care what sort of blood youve got said harry fiercely why would i want to attack muggleborns ive heard you hate those muggles you live with said ernie swiftly its not possible to live with the dursleys and not hate them said harry id like to see you try it he turned on his heel and stormed out of the library earning himself a reproving glare from madam pince who was polishing the gilded cover of a large spellbook harry blundered up the corridor barely noticing where he was going he was in such a fury the result was that he walked into something very large and solid which knocked him backward onto the floor oh hello hagrid harry said looking up hagrids face was entirely hidden by a woolly snowcovered balaclava but it couldnt possibly be anyone else as he filled most of the corridor in his moleskin overcoat a dead rooster was hanging from one of his massive gloved hands all righ harry he said pulling up the balaclava so he could speak why arent yeh in class canceled said harry getting up whatre you doing in here hagrid held up the limp rooster second one killed this term he explained its either foxes or a blood suckin bugbear an i need the headmasters permission ter put a charm around the hen coop he peered more closely at harry from under his thick snowflecked eyebrows yeh sure yehre all righ yeh look all hot an bothered harry couldnt bring himself to repeat what ernie and the rest of the hufflepuffs had been saying about him its nothing he said id better get going hagrid its transfiguration next and ive got to pick up my books he walked off his mind still full of what ernie had said about him justins been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to potter he was muggleborn harry stamped up the stairs and turned along another corridor which was particularly dark the torches had been extinguished by a strong icy draft that was blowing through a loose windowpane he was halfway down the passage when he tripped headlong over something lying on the floor he turned to squint at what hed fallen over and felt as though his stomach had dissolved justin finchfletchley was lying on the floor rigid and cold a look of shock frozen on his face his eyes staring blankly at the ceiling and that wasnt all next to him was another figure the strangest sight harry had ever seen it was nearly headless nick no longer pearlywhite and transparent but black and smoky floating immobile and horizontal six inches off the floor his head was half off and his face wore an expression of shock identical to justins harry got to his feet his breathing fast and shallow his heart doing a kind of drumroll against his ribs he looked wildly up and down the deserted corridor and saw a line of spiders scuttling as fast as they could away from the bodies the only sounds were the muffled voices of teachers from the classes on either side he could run and no one would ever know he had been there but he couldnt just leave them lying here he had to get help would anyone believe he hadnt had anything to do with this as he stood there panicking a door right next to him opened with a bang peeves the poltergeist came shooting out why its potty wee potter cackled peeves knocking harrys glasses askew as he bounced past him whats potter up to whys potter lurking peeves stopped halfway through a midair somersault upside down he spotted justin and nearly headless nick he flipped the right way up filled his lungs and before harry could stop him screamed attack attack another attack no mortal or ghost is safe run for your lives attaaaack crash crash crash door after door flew open along the corridor and people flooded out for several long minutes there was a scene of such confusion that justin was in danger of being squashed and people kept standing in nearly headless nick harry found himself pinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet professor mcgonagall came running followed by her own class one of whom still had blackandwhitestriped hair she used her wand to set off aloud bang which restored silence and ordered everyone back into their classes no sooner had the scene cleared somewhat than ernie the hufflepuff arrived panting on the scene caught in the act ernie yelled his face stark white pointing his finger dramatically at harry that will do macmillan said professor mcgonagall sharply peeves was bobbing overhead now grinning wickedly surveying the scene peeves always loved chaos as the teachers bent over justin and nearly headless nick examining them peeves broke into song oh potter you rotter oh what have you done youre killing off students you think its good fun thats enough peeves barked professor mcgonagall and peeves zoomed away backward with his tongue out at harry justin was carried up to the hospital wing by professor flitwick and professor sinistra of the astronomy department but nobody seemed to know what to do for nearly headless nick in the end professor mcgonagall conjured a large fan out of thin air which she gave to ernie with instructions to waft nearly headless nick up the stairs this ernie did fanning nick along like a silent black hovercraft this left harry and professor mcgonagall alone together this way potter she said professor said harry at once i swear i didnt this is out of my hands potter said professor mcgonagall curtly they marched in silence around a corner and she stopped before a large and extremely ugly stone gargoyle lemon drop she said this was evidently a password because the gargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behind him split in two even full of dread for what was coming harry couldnt fail to be amazed behind the wall was a spiral staircase that was moving smoothly upward like an escalator as he and professor mcgonagall stepped onto it harry heard the wall thud closed behind them they rose upward in circles higher and higher until at last slightly dizzy harry saw a gleaming oak door ahead with a brass knocker in the shape of a griffin he knew now where he was being taken this must be where dumbledore lived chapter twelve the polyjuice potion they stepped off the stone staircase at the top and professor mcgonagall rapped on the door it opened silently and they entered professor mcgonagall told harry to wait and left him there alone harry looked around one thing was certain of all the teachers offices harry had visited so far this year dumbledores was by far the most interesting if he hadnt been scared out of his wits that he was about to be thrown out of school he would have been very pleased to have a chance to look around it it was a large and beautiful circular room full of funny little noises a number of curious silver instruments stood on spindlelegged tables whirring and emitting little puffs of smoke the walls were covered with portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses all of whom were snoozing gently in their frames there was also an enormous clawfooted desk and sitting on a shelf behind it a shabby tattered wizards hat the sorting hat harry hesitated he cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches and wizards on the walls surely it couldnt hurt if he took the hat down and tried it on again just to see just to make sure it had put him in the right house he walked quietly around the desk lifted the hat from its shelf and lowered it slowly onto his head it was much too large and slipped down over his eyes just as it had done the last time hed put it on harry stared at the black inside of the hat waiting then a small voice said in his ear bee in your bonnet harry potter er yes harry muttered er sorry to bother you i wanted to ask youve been wondering whether i put you in the right house said the hat smartly yes you were particularly difficult to place but i stand by what i said before harrys heart leapt you would have done well in slytherin harrys stomach plummeted he grabbed the point of the hat and pulled it off it hung limply in his hand grubby and faded harry pushed it back onto its shelf feeling sick youre wrong he said aloud to the still and silent hat it didnt move harry backed away watching it then a strange gagging noise behind him made him wheel around he wasnt alone after all standing on a golden perch behind the door was a decrepitlooking bird that resembled a halfplucked turkey harry stared at it and the bird looked balefully back making its gagging noise again harry thought it looked very ill its eyes were dull and even as harry watched a couple more feathers fell out of its tail harry was just thinking that all he needed was for dumbledores pet bird to die while he was alone in the office with it when the bird burst into flames harry yelled in shock and backed away into the desk he looked feverishly around in case there was a glass of water somewhere but couldnt see one the bird meanwhile had become a fireball it gave one loud shriek and next second there was nothing but a smouldering pile of ash on the floor the office door opened dumbledore came in looking very somber professor harry gasped your bird i couldnt do anything he just caught fire to harrys astonishment dumbledore smiled about time too he said hes been looking dreadful for days ive been telling him to get a move on he chuckled at the stunned look on harrys face fawkes is a phoenix harry phoenixes burst into flame when it is time for them to die and are reborn from the ashes watch him harry looked down in time to see a tiny wrinkled newborn bird poke its head out of the ashes it was quite as ugly as the old one its a shame you had to see him on a burning day said dumbledore seating himself behind his desk hes really very handsome most of the time wonderful red and gold plumage fascinating creatures phoenixes they can carry immensely heavy loads their tears have healing powers and they make highly faithful pets in the shock of fawkes catching fire harry had forgotten what he was there for but it all came back to him as dumbledore settled himself in the high chair behind the desk and fixed harry with his penetrating lightblue stare before dumbledore could speak another word however the door of the office flew open with an almighty bang and hagrid burst in a wild look in his eyes his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black head and the dead rooster still swinging from his hand it wasn harry professor dumbledore said hagrid urgently i was talkin ter him seconds before that kid was found he never had time sir dumbledore tried to say something but hagrid went ranting on waving the rooster around in his agitation sending feathers everywhere it cantve bin him ill swear it in front o the ministry o magic if i have to hagrid i yehve got the wrong boy sir i know harry never hagrid said dumbledore loudly i do not think that harry attacked those people oh said hagrid the rooster falling limply at his side right ill wait outside then headmaster and he stomped out looking embarrassed you dont think it was me professor harry repeated hopefully as dumbledore brushed rooster feathers off his desk no harry i dont said dumbledore though his face was somber again but i still want to talk to you harry waited nervously while dumbledore considered him the tips of his long fingers together i must ask you harry whether there is anything youd like to tell me he said gently anything at all harry didnt know what to say he thought of malfoy shouting youll be next mudbloods and of the polyjuice potion simmering away in moaning myrtles bathroom then he thought of the disembodied voice he had heard twice and remembered what ron had said hearing voices no one else can hear isnt a good sign even in the wizarding world he thought too about what everyone was saying about him and his growing dread that he was somehow connected with salazar slytherin no said harry there isnt anything professor the double attack on justin and nearly headless nick turned what had hitherto been nervousness into real panic curiously it was nearly headless nicks fate that seemed to worry people most what could possibly do that to a ghost people asked each other what terrible power could harm someone who was already dead there was almost a stampede to book seats on the hogwarts express so that students could go home for christmas at this rate well be the only ones left ron told harry and hermione us malfoy crabbe and goyle what a jolly holiday its going to be crabbe and goyle who always did whatever malfoy did had signed up to stay over the holidays too but harry was glad that most people were leaving he was tired of people skirting around him in the corridors as though he was about to sprout fangs or spit poison tired of all the muttering pointing and hissing as he passed fred and george however found all this very funny they went out of their way to march ahead of harry down the corridors shouting make way for the heir of slytherin seriously evil wizard coming through percy was deeply disapproving of this behavior it is not a laughing matter he said coldly oh get out of the way percy said fred harrys in a hurry yeah hes off to the chamber of secrets for a cup of tea with his fanged servant said george chortling ginny didnt find it amusing either oh dont she wailed every time fred asked harry loudly who he was planning to attack next or when george pretended to ward harry off with a large clove of garlic when they met harry didnt mind it made him feel better that fred and george at least thought the idea of his being slytherins heir was quite ludicrous but their antics seemed to be aggravating draco malfoy who looked increasingly sour each time he saw them at it its because hes bursting to say its really him said ron knowingly you know how he hates anyone beating him at anything and youre getting all the credit for his dirty work not for long said hermione in a satisfied tone the polyjuice potions nearly ready well be getting the truth out of him any day now at last the term ended and a silence deep as the snow on the grounds descended on the castle harry found it peaceful rather than gloomy and enjoyed the fact that he hermione and the weasleys had the run of gryffindor tower which meant they could play exploding snap loudly without bothering anyone and practice dueling in private fred george and ginny had chosen to stay at school rather than visit bill in egypt with mr and mrs weasley percy who disapproved of what he termed their childish behavior didnt spend much time in the gryffindor common room he had already told them pompously that he was only staying over christmas because it was his duty as a prefect to support the teachers during this troubled time christmas morning dawned cold and white harry and ron the only ones left in their dormitory were woken very early by hermione who burst in fully dressed and carrying presents for them both wake up she said loudly pulling back the curtains at the window hermione youre not supposed to be in here said ron shielding his eyes against the light merry christmas to you too said hermione throwing him his present ive been up for nearly an hour adding more lacewings to the potion its ready harry sat up suddenly wide awake are you sure positive said hermione shifting scabbers the rat so that she could sit down on the end of rons fourposter if were going to do it i say it should be tonight at that moment hedwig swooped into the room carrying a very small package in her beak hello said harry happily as she landed on his bed are you speaking to me again she nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way which was a far better present than the one that she had brought him which turned out to be from the dursleys they had sent harry a toothpick and a note telling him to find out whether hed be able to stay at hogwarts for the summer vacation too the rest of harrys christmas presents were far more satisfactory hagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle fudge which harry decided to soften by the fire before eating ron had given him a book called flying with the cannons a book of interesting facts about his favorite quidditch team and hermione had bought him a luxury eaglefeather quill harry opened the last present to find a new handknitted sweater from mrs weasley and a large plum cake he read her card with a fresh surge of guilt thinking about mr weasleys car which hadnt been seen since its crash with the whomping willow and the bout of rulebreaking he and ron were planning next no one not even someone dreading taking polyjuice potion later could fail to enjoy christmas dinner at hogwarts the great hall looked magnificent not only were there a dozen frost covered christmas trees and thick streamers of holly and mistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling but enchanted snow was falling warm and dry from the ceiling dumbledore led them in a few of his favorite carols hagrid booming more and more loudly with every goblet of eggnog he consumed percy who hadnt noticed that fred had bewitched his prefect badge so that it now read pinhead kept asking them all what they were sniggering at harry didnt even care that draco malfoy was making loud snide remarks about his new sweater from the slytherin table with a bit of luck malfoy would be getting his comeuppance in a few hours time harry and ron had barely finished their third helpings of christmas pudding when hermione ushered them out of the hall to finalize their plans for the evening we still need a bit of the people youre changing into said hermione matteroffacdy as though she were sending them to the supermarket for laundry detergent and obviously itll be best if you can get something of crabbes and goyles theyre malfoys best friends hell tell them anything and we also need to make sure the real crabbe and goyle cant burst in on us while were interrogating him ive got it all worked out she went on smoothly ignoring harrys and rons stupefied faces she held up two plump chocolate cakes ive filled these with a simple sleeping draught all you have to do is make sure crabbe and goyle find them you know how greedy they are theyre bound to eat them once theyre asleep pull out a few of their hairs and hide them in a broom closet harry and ron looked incredulously at each other hermione i dont think that could go seriously wrong but hermione had a steely glint in her eye not unlike the one professor mcgonagall sometimes had the potion will be useless without crabbes and goyles hair she said sternly you do want to investigate malfoy dont you oh all right all right said harry but what about you whose hair are you ripping out ive already got mine said hermione brightly pulling a tiny bottle out of her pocket and showing them the single hair inside it remember millicent bulstrode wrestling with me at the dueling club she left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle me and shes gone home for christmas so ill just have to tell the slytherins ive decided to come back when hermione had bustled off to check on the polyjuice potion again ron turned to harry with a doomladen expression have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong but to harrys and rons utter amazement stage one of the operation went just as smoothly as hermione had said they lurked in the deserted entrance hall after christmas tea waiting for crabbe and goyle who had remained alone at the slytherin table shoveling down fourth helpings of trifle harry had perched the chocolate cakes on the end of the banisters when they spotted crabbe and goyle coming out of the great hall harry and ron hid quickly behind a suit of armor next to the front door how thick can you get ron whispered ecstatically as crabbe gleefully pointed out the cakes to goyle and grabbed them grinning stupidly they stuffed the cakes whole into their large mouths for a moment both of them chewed greedily looks of triumph on their faces then without the smallest change of expression they both keeled over backward onto the floor by far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hall once they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops harry yanked out a couple of the bristles that covered goyles forehead and ron pulled out several of crabbes hairs they also stole their shoes because their own were far too small for crabbe and goylesize feet then still stunned at what they had just done they sprinted up to moaning myrtles bathroom they could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the stall in which hermione was stirring the cauldron pulling their robes up over their faces harry and ron knocked softly on the door hermione they heard the scrape of the lock and hermione emerged shinyfaced and looking anxious behind her they heard the gloop gloop of the bubbling glutinous potion three glass tumblers stood ready on the toilet seat did you get them hermione asked breathlessly harry showed her goyles hair good and i sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry hermione said holding up a small sack youll need bigger sizes once youre crabbe and goyle the three of them stared into the cauldron close up the potion looked like thick dark mud bubbling sluggishly im sure ive done everything right said hermione nervously rereading the splotched page of moste potente potions it looks like the book says it should once weve drunk it well have exactly an hour before we change back into ourselves now what ron whispered we separate it into three glasses and add the hairs hermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each of the glasses then her hand trembling she shook millicent bulstrodes hair out of its bottle into the first glass the potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly a second later it had turned a sick sort of yellow urgh essence of millicent bulstrode said ron eyeing it with loathing bet it tastes disgusting add yours then said hermione harry dropped goyles hair into the middle glass and ron put crabbes into the last one both glasses hissed and frothed goyles turned the khaki color of a booger crabbes a dark murky brown hang on said harry as ron and hermione reached for their glasses wed better not all drink them in here once we turn into crabbe and goyle we wont fit and millicent bulstrodes no pixie good thinking said ron unlocking the door well take separate stalls careful not to spill a drop of his polyjuice potion harry slipped into the middle stall ready he called ready came rons and hermiones voices one two three pinching his nose harry drank the potion down in two large gulps it tasted like overcooked cabbage immediately his insides started writhing as though hed just swallowed live snakes doubled up he wondered whether he was going to be sick then a burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to the very ends of his fingers and toes next bringing him gasping to all fours came a horrible melting feeling as the skin all over his body bubbled like hot wax and before his eyes his hands began to grow the fingers thickened the nails broadened the knuckles were bulging like bolts his shoulders stretched painfully and a prickling on his forehead told him that hair was creeping down toward his eyebrows his robes ripped as his chest expanded like a barrel bursting its hoops his feet were agony in shoes four sizes too small as suddenly as it had started everything stopped harry lay facedown on the stonecold floor listening to myrtle gurgling morosely in the end toilet with difficulty he kicked off his shoes and stood up so this was what it felt like being goyle his large hand trembling he pulled off his old robes which were hanging a foot above his ankles pulled on the spare ones and laced up goyles boatlike shoes he reached up to brush his hair out of his eyes and met only the short growth of wiry bristles low on his forehead then he realized that his glasses were clouding his eyes because goyle obviously didnt need them he took them off and called are you two okay goyles low rasp of a voice issued from his mouth yeah came the deep grunt of crabbe from his right harry unlocked his door and stepped in front of the cracked mirror goyle stared back at him out of dull deepset eyes harry scratched his ear so did goyle rons door opened they stared at each other except that he looked pale and shocked ron was indistinguishable from crabbe from the puddingbowl haircut to the long gorilla arms this is unbelievable said ron approaching the mirror and prodding crabbes flat nose unbelievable wed better get going said harry loosening the watch that was cutting into goyles thick wrist weve still got to find out where the slytherin common room is i only hope we can find someone to follow ron who had been gazing at harry said you dont know how bizarre it is to see goyle thinking he banged on hermiones door cmon we need to go a highpitched voice answered him i i dont think im going to come after all you go on without me hermione we know millicent bulstrodes ugly no ones going to know its you no really i dont think ill come you two hurry up youre wasting time harry looked at ron bewildered that looks more like goyle said ron thats how he looks every time a teacher asks him a question hermione are you okay said harry through the door fine im fine go on harry looked at his watch five of their precious sixty minutes had already passed well meet you back here all right he said harry and ron opened the door of the bathroom carefully checked that the coast was clear and set off dont swing your arms like that harry muttered to ron eh crabbe holds them sort of stiff hows this yeah thats better they went down the marble staircase all they needed now was a slytherin that they could follow to the slytherin common room but there was nobody around any ideas muttered harry the slytherins always come up to breakfast from over there said ron nodding at the entrance to the dungeons the words had barely left his mouth when a girl with long curly hair emerged from the entrance excuse me said ron hurrying up to her weve forgotten the way to our common room i beg your pardon said the girl stiffly our common room im a ravenclaw she walked away looking suspiciously back at them harry and ron hurried down the stone steps into the darkness their footsteps echoing particularly loudly as crabbes and goyles huge feet hit the floor feeling that this wasnt going to be as easy as they had hoped the labyrinthine passages were deserted they walked deeper and deeper under the school constantly checking their watches to see how much time they had left after a quarter of an hour just when they were getting desperate they heard a sudden movement ahead ha said ron excitedly theres one of them now the figure was emerging from a side room as they hurried nearer however their hearts sank it wasnt a slytherin it was percy whatre you doing down here said ron in surprise percy looked affronted that he said stiffly is none of your business its crabbe isnt it wh oh yeah said ron well get off to your dormitories said percy sternly its not safe to go wandering around dark corridors these days you are ron pointed out i said percy drawing himself up am a prefect nothings about to attack me a voice suddenly echoed behind harry and ron draco malfoy was strolling toward them and for the first time in his life harry was pleased to see him there you are he drawled looking at them have you two been pigging out in the great hall all this time ive been looking for you i want to show you something really funny malfoy glanced witheringly at percy and whatre you doing down here weasley he sneered percy looked outraged you want to show a bit more respect to a school prefect he said i dont like your attitude malfoy sneered and motioned for harry and ron to follow him harry almost said something apologetic to percy but caught himself just in time he and ron hurried after malfoy who said as they turned into the next passage that peter weasley percy ron corrected him automatically whatever said malfoy ive noticed him sneaking around a lot lately and i bet i know what hes up to he thinks hes going to catch slytherins heir singlehanded he gave a short derisive laugh harry and ron exchanged excited looks malfoy paused by a stretch of bare damp stone wall whats the new password again he said to harry er said harry oh yeah pureblood said malfoy not listening and a stone door concealed in the wall slid open malfoy marched through it and harry and ron followed him the slytherin common room was a long low underground room with rough stone walls and ceiling from which round greenish lamps were hanging on chains a fire was crackling under an elaborately carved mantelpiece ahead of them and several slytherins were silhouetted around it in highbacked chairs wait here said malfoy to harry and ron motioning them to a pair of empty chairs set back from the fire ill go and get it my fathers just sent it to me wondering what malfoy was going to show them harry and ron sat down doing their best to look at home malfoy came back a minute later holding what looked like a newspaper clipping he thrust it under rons nose thatll give you a laugh he said harry saw rons eyes widen in shock he read the clipping quickly gave a very forced laugh and handed it to harry it had been clipped out of the daily prophet and it said inquiry at the ministry of magic arthur weasley head of the misuse of muggle artifacts office was today fined fifty galleons for bewitching a muggle car mr lucius malfoy a governor of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry where the enchanted car crashed earlier this year called today for mr weasleys resignation weasley has brought the ministry into disrepute mr malfoy told our reporter he is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and his ridiculous muggle protection act should be scrapped immediately mr weasley was unavailable for comment although his wife told reporters to clear off or shed set the family ghoul on them well said malfoy impatiently as harry handed the clipping back to him dont you think its funny ha ha said harry bleakly arthur weasley loves muggles so much he should snap his wand in half and go and join them said malfoy scornfully youd never know the weasleys were purebloods the way they behave rons or rather crabbes face was contorted with fury whats up with you crabbe snapped malfoy stomachache ron grunted well go up to the hospital wing and give all those mudbloods a kick from me said malfoy snickering you know im surprised the daily prophet hasnt reported all these attacks yet he went on thoughtfully i suppose dumbledores trying to hush it all up hell be sacked if it doesnt stop soon fathers always said old dumbledores the worst thing thats ever happened to this place he loves muggleborns a decent headmaster would neverve let slime like that creevey in malfoy started taking pictures with an imaginary camera and did a cruel but accurate impression of colin potter can i have your picture potter can i have your autograph can i lick your shoes please potter he dropped his hands and looked at harry and ron whats the matter with you two far too late harry and ron forced themselves to laugh but malfoy seemed satisfied perhaps crabbe and goyle were always slow on the uptake saint potter the mudbloods friend said malfoy slowly hes another one with no proper wizard feeling or he wouldnt go around with that jumped up granger mudblood and people think hes slytherins heir harry and ron waited with bated breath malfoy was surely seconds away from telling them it was him but then i wish i knew who it is said malfoy petulantly i could help them rons jaw dropped so that crabbe looked even more clueless than usual fortunately malfoy didnt notice and harry thinking fast said you must have some idea whos behind it all you know i havent goyle how many times do i have to tell you snapped malfoy and father wont tell me anything about the last time the chamber was opened either of course it was fifty years ago so it was before his time but he knows all about it and he says that it was all kept quiet and itll look suspicious if i know too much about it but i know one thing last time the chamber of secrets was opened a mudblood died so i bet its a matter of time before one of thems killed this time i hope its granger he said with relish ron was clenching crabbes gigantic fists feeling that it would be a bit of a giveaway if ron punched malfoy harry shot him a warning look and said dyou know if the person who opened the chamber last time was caught oh yeah whoever it was was expelled said malfoy theyre probably still in azkaban azkaban said harry puzzled azkaban the wizard prison goyle said malfoy looking at him in disbelief honestly if you were any slower youd be going backward he shifted restlessly in his chair and said father says to keep my head down and let the heir of slytherin get on with it he says the school needs ridding of all the mudblood filth but not to get mixed up in it of course hes got a lot on his plate at the moment you know the ministry of magic raided our manor last week harry tried to force goyles dull face into a look of concern yeah said malfoy luckily they didnt find much fathers got some very valuable dark arts stuff but luckily weve got our own secret chamber under the drawingroom floor ho said ron malfoy looked at him so did harry ron blushed even his hair was turning red his nose was also slowly lengthening their hour was up ron was turning back into himself and from the look of horror he was suddenly giving harry he must be too they both jumped to their feet medicine for my stomach ron grunted and without further ado they sprinted the length of the slytherin common room hurled themselves at the stone wall and dashed up the passage hoping against hope that malfoy hadnt noticed anything harry could feel his feet slipping around in goyles huge shoes and had to hoist up his robes as he shrank they crashed up the steps into the dark entrance hall which was full of a muffled pounding coming from the closet where theyd locked crabbe and goyle leaving their shoes outside the closet door they sprinted in their socks up the marble staircase toward moaning myrtles bathroom well it wasnt a complete waste of time ron panted closing the bathroom door behind them i know we still havent found out whos doing the attacks but im going to write to dad tomorrow and tell him to check under the malfoys drawing room harry checked his face in the cracked mirror he was back to normal he put his glasses on as ron hammered on the door of hermiones stall hermione come out weve got loads to tell you go away hermione squeaked harry and ron looked at each other whats the matter said ron you must be back to normal by now we are but moaning myrtle glided suddenly through the stall door harry had never seen her looking so happy ooooooh wait till you see she said its awful they heard the lock slide back and hermione emerged sobbing her robes pulled up over her head whats up said ron uncertainly have you still got millicents nose or something hermione let her robes fall and ron backed into the sink her face was covered in black fur her eyes had turned yellow and there were long pointed ears poking through her hair it was a ccat hair she howled mmillicent bulstrode mmust have a cat and the ppotion isnt supposed to be used for animal transformations uhoh said ron youll be teased something dreadful said myrtle happily its okay hermione said harry quickly well take you up to the hospital wing madam pomfrey never asks too many questions it took a long time to persuade hermione to leave the bathroom moaning myrtle sped them on their way with a hearty guffaw wait till everyone finds out youve got a tail chapter thirteen the very secret diary hermione remained in the hospital wing for several weeks there was a flurry of rumor about her disappearance when the rest of the school arrived back from their christmas holidays because of course everyone thought that she had been attacked so many students filed past the hospital wing trying to catch a glimpse of her that madam pomfrey took out her curtains again and placed them around hermiones bed to spare her the shame of being seen with a furry face harry and ron went to visit her every evening when the new term started they brought her each days homework if id sprouted whiskers id take a break from work said ron tipping a stack of books onto hermiones bedside table one evening dont be silly ron ive got to keep up said hermione briskly her spirits were greatly improved by the fact that all the hair had gone from her face and her eyes were turning slowly back to brown i dont suppose youve got any new leads she added in a whisper so that madam pomfrey couldnt hear her nothing said harry gloomily i was so sure it was malfoy said ron for about the hundredth time whats that asked harry pointing to something gold sticking out from under hermiones pillow just a get well card said hermione hastily trying to poke it out of sight but ron was too quick for her he pulled it out flicked it open and read aloud to miss granger wishing you a speedy recovery from your concerned teacher professor gilderoy lockhart order of merlin third class honorary member of the dark force defense league and fivetime winner of witch weeklys most charmingsmile award ron looked up at hermione disgusted you sleep with this under your pillow but hermione was spared answering by madam pomfrey sweeping over with her evening dose of medicine is lockhart the smarmiest bloke youve ever met or what ron said to harry as they left the infirmary and started up the stairs toward gryffindor tower snape had given them so much homework harry thought he was likely to be in the sixth year before he finished it ron was just saying he wished he had asked hermione how many rat tails you were supposed to add to a hairraising potion when an angry outburst from the floor above reached their ears thats filch harry muttered as they hurried up the stairs and paused out of sight listening hard you dont think someone elses been attacked said ron tensely they stood still their heads inclined toward flichs voice which sounded quite hysterical even more work for me mopping all night like i havent got enough to do no this is the final straw im going to dumbledore his footsteps receded along the outofsight corridor and they heard a distant door slam they poked their heads around the corner filch had clearly been manning his usual lookout post they were once again on the spot where mrs norris had been attacked they saw at a glance what filch had been shouting about a great flood of water stretched over half the corridor and it looked as though it was still seeping from under the door of moaning myrtles bathroom now that filch had stopped shouting they could hear myrtles wails echoing off the bathroom walls now whats up with her said ron lets go and see said harry and holding their robes over their ankles they stepped through the great wash of water to the door bearing its out of order sign ignored it as always and entered moaning myrtle was crying if possible louder and harder than ever before she seemed to be hiding down her usual toilet it was dark in the bathroom because the candles had been extinguished in the great rush of water that had left both walls and floor soaking wet whats up myrtle said harry whos that glugged myrtle miserably come to throw something else at me harry waded across to her stall and said why would i throw something at you dont ask me myrtle shouted emerging with a wave of yet more water which splashed onto the already sopping floor here i am minding my own business and someone thinks its funny to throw a book at me but it cant hurt you if someone throws something at you said harry reasonably i mean itd just go right through you wouldnt it he had said the wrong thing myrtle puffed herself up and shrieked lets all throw books at myrtle because she cant feel it ten points if you can get it through her stomach fifty points if it goes through her head well ha ha ha what a lovely game i dont think who threw it at you anyway asked harry i dont know i was just sitting in the ubend thinking about death and it fell right through the top of my head said myrtle glaring at them its over there it got washed out harry and ron looked under the sink where myrtle was pointing a small thin book lay there it had a shabby black cover and was as wet as everything else in the bathroom harry stepped forward to pick it up but ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold him back what said harry are you crazy said ron it could be dangerous dangeroussaid harry laughing come off it how could it be dangerous youd be surprised said ron who was looking apprehensively at the book some of the books the ministrys confiscated dads told me there was one that burned your eyes out and everyone who read sonnets of a sorcerer spoke in limericks for the rest of their lives and some old witch in bath had a book that you could never stop reading you just had to wander around with your nose in it trying to do everything onehanded and all right ive got the point said harry the little book lay on the floor nondescript and soggy well we wont find out unless we look at it he said and he ducked around ron and picked it up off the floor harry saw at once that it was a diary and the faded year on the cover told him it was fifty years old he opened it eagerly on the first page he could just make out the name t m riddle in smudged ink hang on said ron who had approached cautiously and was looking over harrys shoulder i know that name t m riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago how on earth dyou know that said harry in amazement because filch made me polish his shield about fifty times in detention said ron resentfully that was the one i burped slugs all over if youd wiped slime off a name for an hour youd remember it too harry peeled the wet pages apart they were completely blank there wasnt the faintest trace of writing on any of them not even auntie mabels birthday or dentist halfpast three he never wrote in it said harry disappointed i wonder why someone wanted to flush it away said ron curiously harry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed name of a variety store on vauxhall road london he mustve been muggleborn said harry thoughtfufly to have bought a diary from vauxhall road well its not much use to you said ron he dropped his voice fifty points if you can get it through myrtles nose harry however pocketed it hermione left the hospital wing dewhiskered tailless and furfree at the beginning of february on her first evening back in gryffindor tower harry showed her t m riddles diary and told her the story of how they had found it oooh it might have hidden powers said hermione enthusiastically taking the diary and looking at it closely if it has its hiding them very well said ron maybe its shy i dont know why you dont chuck it harry i wish i knew why someone did try to chuck it said harry i wouldnt mind knowing how riddle got an award for special services to hogwarts either couldve been anything said ron maybe he got thirty owls or saved a teacher from the giant squid maybe he murdered myrtle that wouldve done everyone a favor but harry could tell from the arrested look on hermiones face that she was thinking what he was thinking what said ron looking from one to the other well the chamber of secrets was opened fifty years ago wasnt it he said thats what malfoy said yeah said ron slowly and this diary is fifty years old said hermione tapping it excitedly so oh ron wake up snapped hermione we know the person who opened the chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago we know t m riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago well what if riddle got his special award for catching the heir of slytherin his diary would probably tell us everything where the chamber is and how to open it and what sort of creature lives in it the person whos behind the attacks this time wouldnt want that lying around would they thats a brilliant theory hermione said ron with just one tiny little flaw theres nothing written in his diary but hermione was pulling her wand out of her bag it might be invisible ink she whispered she tapped the diary three times and said aparecium nothing happened undaunted hermione shoved her hand back into her bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser its a revealer i got it in diagon alley she said she rubbed hard on january first nothing happened im telling you theres nothing to find in there said ron riddle just got a diary for christmas and couldnt be bothered filling it in harry couldnt explain even to himself why he didnt just throw riddles diary away the fact was that even though he knew the diary was blank he kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages as though it were a story he wanted to finish and while harry was sure he had never heard the name t m riddle before it still seemed to mean something to him almost as though riddle was a friend hed had when he was very small and had halfforgotten but this was absurd hed never had friends before hogwarts dudley had made sure of that nevertheless harry was determined to find out more about riddle so next day at break he headed for the trophy room to examine riddles special award accompanied by an interested hermione and a thoroughly unconvinced ron who told them hed seen enough of the trophy room to last him a lifetime riddles burnished gold shield was tucked away in a corner cabinet it didnt carry details of why it had been given to him good thing too or itd be even bigger and id still be polishing it said ron however they did find riddles name on an old medal for magical merit and on a list of old head boys he sounds like percy said ron wrinkling his nose in disgust prefect head boy probably top of every class you say that like its a bad thing said hermione in a slightly hurt voice the sun had now begun to shine weakly on hogwarts again inside the castle the mood had grown more hopeful there had been no more attacks since those on justin and nearly headless nick and madam pomfrey was pleased to report that the mandrakes were becoming moody and secretive meaning that they were fast leaving childhood the moment their acne clears up theyll be ready for repotting again harry heard her telling filch kindly one afternoon and after that it wont be long until were cutting them up and stewing them youll have mrs norris back in no time perhaps the heir of slytherin had lost his or her nerve thought harry it must be getting riskier and riskier to open the chamber of secrets with the school so alert and suspicious perhaps the monster whatever it was was even now settling itself down to hibernate for another fifty years ernie macmillan of hufflepuff didnt take this cheerful view he was still convinced that harry was the guilty one that he had given himself away at the dueling club peeves wasnt helping matters he kept popping up in the crowded corridors singing oh potter you rotter now with a dance routine to match gilderoy lockhart seemed to think he himself had made the attacks stop harry overheard him telling professor mcgonagall so while the gryffindors were lining up for transfiguration i dont think therell be any more trouble minerva he said tapping his nose knowingly and winking i think the chamber has been locked for good this time the culprit must have known it was only a matter of time before i caught him rather sensible to stop now before i came down hard on him you know what the school needs now is a moralebooster wash away the memories of last term i wont say any more just now but i think i know just the thing he tapped his nose again and strode off lockharts idea of a moralebooster became clear at breakfast time on february fourteenth harry hadnt had much sleep because of a laterunning quidditch practice the night before and he hurried down to the great hall slightly late he thought for a moment that hed walked through the wrong doors the walls were all covered with large lurid pink flowers worse still heart shaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling harry went over to the gryffindor table where ron was sitting looking sickened and hermione seemed to have been overcome with giggles whats going on harry asked them sitting down and wiping confetti off his bacon ron pointed to the teachers table apparently too disgusted to speak lockhart wearing lurid pink robes to match the decorations was waving for silence the teachers on either side of him were looking stonyfaced from where he sat harry could see a muscle going in professor mcgonagalls cheek snape looked as though someone had just fed him a large beaker of skelegro happy valentines day lockhart shouted and may i thank the forty six people who have so far sent me cards yes i have taken the liberty of arranging this little surprise for you all and it doesnt end here lockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to the entrance hall marched a dozen surlylooking dwarfs not just any dwarfs however lockhart had them all wearing golden wings and carrying harps my friendly cardcarrying cupids beamed lockhart they will be roving around the school today delivering your valentines and the fun doesnt stop here im sure my colleagues will want to enter into the spirit of the occasion why not ask professor snape to show you how to whip up a love potion and while youre at it professor flitwick knows more about entrancing enchantments than any wizard ive ever met the sly old dog professor flitwick buried his face in his hands snape was look ing as though the first person to ask him for a love potion would be forcefed poison please hermione tell me you werent one of the fortysix said ron as they left the great hall for their first lesson hermione suddenly became very interested in searching her bag for her schedule and didnt answer all day long the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver valentines to the annoyance of the teachers and late that afternoon as the gryffindors were walking upstairs for charms one of the dwarfs caught up with harry oy you arty potter shouted a particularly grimlooking dwarf elbowing people out of the way to get to harry hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of first years which happened to include ginny weasley harry tried to escape the dwarf however cut his way through the crowd by kicking peoples shins and reached him before hed gone two paces ive got a musical message to deliver to arry potter in person he said twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way not here harry hissed trying to escape stay still grunted the dwarf grabbing hold of harrys bag and pulling him back let me go harry snarled tugging with a loud ripping noise his bag split in two his books wand parchment and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashed over everything harry scrambled around trying to pick it all up before the dwarf started singing causing something of a holdup in the corridor whats going on here came the cold drawling voice of draco malfoy harry started stuffing everything feverishly into his ripped bag desperate to get away before malfoy could hear his musical valentine whats all this commotion said another familiar voice as percy weasley arrived losing his head harry tried to make a run for it but the dwarf seized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor right he said sitting on harrys ankles here is your singing valentine his eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad his hair is as dark as a blackboard i wish he was mine hes really divine the hero who conquered the dark lord harry would have given all the gold in gringotts to evaporate on the spot trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else he got up his feet numb from the weight of the dwarf as percy weasley did his best to disperse the crowd some of whom were crying with mirth off you go off you go the bell rang five minutes ago off to class now he said shooing some of the younger students away and you malfoy harry glancing over saw malfoy stoop and snatch up something leering he showed it to crabbe and goyle and harry realized that hed got riddles diary give that back said harry quietly wonder what potters written in this said malfoy who obviously hadnt noticed the year on the cover and thought he had harrys own diary a hush fell over the onlookers ginny was staring from the diary to harry looking terrified hand it over malfoy said percy sternly when ive had a look said malfoy waving the diary tauntingly at harry percy said as a school prefect but harry had lost his temper he pulled out his wand and shouted expelliarmus and just as snape had disarmed lockhart so malfoy found the diary shooting out of his hand into the air ron grinning broadly caught it harry said percy loudly no magic in the corridors ill have to report this you know but harry didnt care he was oneup on malfoy and that was worth five points from gryffindor any day malfoy was looking furious and as ginny passed him to enter her classroom he yelled spitefully after her i dont think potter liked your valentine much ginny covered her face with her hands and ran into class snarling ron pulled out his wand too but harry pulled him away ron didnt need to spend the whole of charms belching slugs it wasnt until they had reached professor flitwicks class that harry noticed something rather odd about riddles diary all his other books were drenched in scarlet ink the diary however was as clean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it he tried to point this out to ron but ron was having trouble with his wand again large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end and he wasnt much interested in anything else harry went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night this was partly because he didnt think he could stand fred and george singing his eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad one more time and partly because he wanted to examine riddles diary again and knew that ron thought he was wasting his time harry sat on his fourposter and flicked through the blank pages not one of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it then he pulled a new bottle out of his bedside cabinet dipped his quill into it and dropped a blot onto the first page of the diary the ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then as though it was being sucked into the page vanished excited harry loaded up his quill a second time and wrote my name is harry potter the words shone momentarily on the page and they too sank without trace then at last something happened oozing back out of the page in his very own ink came words harry had never written hello harry potter my name is tom riddle how did you come by my diary these words too faded away but not before harry had started to scribble back someone tried to flush it down a toilet he waited eagerly for riddles reply lucky that i recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink but i always knew that there would be those who would not want this diary read what do you mean harry scrawled blotting the page in his excitement i mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things things that were covered up things that happened at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry thats where i am now harry wrote quickly im at hogwarts and horrible stuffs been happening do you know anything about the chamber of secrets his heart was hammering riddles reply came quickly his writing becoming untidier as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew of course i know about the chamber of secrets in my day they told us it was a legend that it did not exist but this was a lie in my fifth year the chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students finally killing one i caught the person whod opened the chamber and he was expelled but the headmaster professor dippet ashamed that such a thing had happened at hogwarts forbade me to tell the truth a story was given out that thegirl had died in a freak accident they gave me a nice shiny engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut but i knew it could happen again the monster lived on and the one who had the power to release it was not imprisoned harry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back its happening again now there have been three attacks and no one seems to know whos behind them who was it last time i can show you if you like came riddles reply you dont have to take my word for it i can take you inside my memory of the night when i caught him harry hesitated his quill suspended over the diary what did riddle mean how could he be taken inside somebody elses memory he glanced nervously at the door to the dormitory which was growing dark when he looked back at the diary he saw fresh words forming let me show you harry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters ok the pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind stopping halfway through the month of june mouth hanging open harry saw that the little square for june thirteenth seemed to have turned into a miniscule television screen his hands trembling slightly he raised the book to press his eye against the little window and before he knew what was happening he was tilting forward the window was widening he felt his body leave his bed and he was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page into a whirl of color and shadow he felt his feet hit solid ground and stood shaking as the blurred shapes around him came suddenly into focus he knew immediately where he was this circular room with the sleeping portraits was dumbledores office but it wasnt dumbledore who was sitting behind the desk a wizened fraillooking wizard bald except for a few wisps of white hair was reading a letter by candlelight harry had never seen this man before im sorry he said shakily i didnt mean to butt in but the wizard didnt look up he continued to read frowning slightly harry drew nearer to his desk and stammered er ill just go shall i still the wizard ignored him he didnt seem even to have heard him thinking that the wizard might be deaf harry raised his voice sorry i disturbed you ill go now he halfshouted the wizard folded up the letter with a sigh stood up walked past harry without glancing at him and went to draw the curtains at his window the sky outside the window was rubyred it seemed to be sunset the wizard went back to the desk sat down and twiddled his thumbs watching the door harry looked around the office no fawkes the phoenix no whirring silver contraptions this was hogwarts as riddle had known it meaning that this unknown wizard was headmaster not dumbledore and he harry was little more than a phantom completely invisible to the people of fifty years ago there was a knock on the office door enter said the old wizard in a feeble voice a boy of about sixteen entered taking off his pointed hat a silver prefects badge was glinting on his chest he was much taller than harry but he too had jetblack hair ah riddle said the headmaster you wanted to see me professor dippet said riddle he looked nervous sit down said dippet ive just been reading the letter you sent me oh said riddle he sat down gripping his hands together very tightly my dear boy said dipper kindly i cannot possibly let you stay at school over the summer surely you want to go home for the holidays no said riddle at once id much rather stay at hogwarts than go back to that to that you live in a muggle orphanage during the holidays i believe said dippet curiously yes sir said riddle reddening slightly you are muggleborn halfblood sir said riddle muggle father witch mother and are both your parents my mother died just after i was born sir they told me at the orphanage she lived just long enough to name me tom after my father marvolo after my grandfather dipper clucked his tongue sympathetically the thing is tom he sighed special arrangements might have been made for you but in the current circumstances you mean all these attacks sir said riddle and harrys heart leapt and he moved closer scared of missing anything precisely said the headmaster my dear boy you must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends particularly in light of the recent tragedy the death of that poor little girl you will be safer by far at your orphanage as a matter of fact the ministry of magic is even now talking about closing the school we are no nearer locating the er source of all this unpleasantness riddles eyes had widened sir if the person was caught if it all stopped what do you mean said dippet with a squeak in his voice sitting up in his chair riddle do you mean you know something about these attacks no sir said riddle quickly but harry was sure it was the same sort of no that he himself had given dumbledore dippet sank back looking faintly disappointed you may go tom riddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room harry followed him down the moving spiral staircase they went emerging next to the gargoyle in the darkening corridor riddle stopped and so did harry watching him harry could tell that riddle was doing some serious thinking he was biting his lip his forehead furrowed then as though he had suddenly reached a decision he hurried off harry gliding noiselessly behind him they didnt see another person until they reached the entrance hall when a tall wizard with long sweeping auburn hair and a beard called to riddle from the marble staircase what are you doing wandering around this late tom harry gaped at the wizard he was none other than a fiftyyearyounger dumbledore i had to see the headmaster sir said riddle well hurry off to bed said dumbledore giving riddle exactly the kind of penetrating stare harry knew so well best not to roam the corridors these days not since he sighed heavily bade riddle good night and strode off riddle watched him walk out of sight and then moving quickly headed straight down the stone steps to the dungeons with harry in hot pursuit but to harrys disappointment riddle led him not into a hidden passageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which harry had potions with snape the torches hadnt been lit and when riddle pushed the door almost closed harry could only just see him standing stockstill by the door watching the passage outside it felt to harry that they were there for at least an hour all he could see was the figure of riddle at the door staring through the crack waiting like a statue and just when harry had stopped feeling expectant and tense and started wishing he could return to the present he heard something move beyond the door someone was creeping along the passage he heard whoever it was pass the dungeon where he and riddle were hidden riddle quiet as a shadow edged through the door and followed harry tiptoeing behind him forgetting that he couldnt be heard for perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps until riddle stopped suddenly his head inclined in the direction of new noises harry heard a door creak open and then someone speaking in a hoarse whisper cmon gotta get yeh outta here cmon now in the box there was something familiar about that voice riddle suddenly jumped around the corner harry stepped out behind him he could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching in front of an open door a very large box next to it evening rubeus said riddle sharply the boy slammed the door shut and stood up what yer doin down here tom riddle stepped closer its all over he said im going to have to turn you in rubeus theyre talking about closing hogwarts if the attacks dont stop what dyeh i dont think you meant to kill anyone but monsters dont make good pets i suppose you just let it out for exercise and it never killed no one said the large boy backing against the closed door from behind him harry could hear a funny rustling and clicking come on rubeus said riddle moving yet closer the dead girls parents will be here tomorrow the least hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered it wasnt him roared the boy his voice echoing in the dark passage he wouldn he never stand aside said riddle drawing out his wand his spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light the door behind the large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wall opposite and out of it came something that made harry let out a long piercing scream unheard by anyone a vast lowslung hairy body and a tangle of black legs a gleam of many eyes and a pair of razorsharp pincers riddle raised his wand again but he was too late the thing bowled him over as it scuttled away tearing up the corridor and out of sight riddle scrambled to his feet looking after it he raised his wand but the huge boy leapt on him seized his wand and threw him back down yelling nooooooo the scene whirled the darkness became complete harry felt himself falling and with a crash he landed spreadeagled on his fourposter in the gryffindor dormitory riddles diary lying open on his stomach before he had had time to regain his breath the dormitory door opened and ron came in there you are he said harry sat up he was sweating and shaking whats up said ron looking at him with concern it was hagrid ron hagrid opened the chamber of secrets fifty years ago chapter fourteen cornelius fudge harry ron and hermione had always known that hagrid had an unfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures during their first year at hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden house and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant three headed dog hed christened fluffy and if as a boy hagrid had heard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle harry was sure hed have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of it hed probably thought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up so long and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legs harry could just imagine the thirteenyearold hagrid trying to fit a leash and collar on it but he was equally certain that hagrid would never have meant to kill anybody harry half wished he hadnt found out how to work riddles diary again and again ron and hermione made him recount what hed seen until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the long circular conversations that followed riddle might have got the wrong person said hermione maybe it was some other monster that was attacking people how many monsters dyou think this place can hold ron asked dully we always knew hagrid had been expelled said harry miserably and the attacks mustve stopped after hagrid was kicked out otherwise riddle wouldnt have got his award ron tried a different tack riddle does sound like percy who asked him to squeal on hagrid anyway but the monster had killed someone ron said hermione and riddle was going to go back to some muggle orphanage if they closed hogwarts said harry i dont blame him for wanting to stay here you met hagrid down knockturn alley didnt you harry he was buying a flesheating slug repellent said harry quickly the three of them fell silent after a long pause hermione voiced the knottiest question of all in a hesitant voice do you think we should go and ask hagrid about it all thatd be a cheerful visit said ron hello hagrid tell us have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately in the end they decided that they would not say anything to hagrid unless there was another attack and as more and more days went by with no whisper from the disembodied voice they became hopeful that they would never need to talk to him about why he had been expelled it was now nearly four months since justin and nearly headless nick had been petrified and nearly everybody seemed to think that the attacker whoever it was had retired for good peeves had finally got bored of his oh potter you rotter song ernie macmillan asked harry quite politely to pass a bucket of leaping toadstools in herbology one day and in march several of the mandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three this made professor sprout very happy the moment they start trying to move into each others pots well know theyre fully mature she told harry then well be able to revive those poor people in the hospital wing the second years were given something new to think about during their easter holidays the time had come to choose their subjects for the third year a matter that hermione at least took very seriously it could affect our whole future she told harry and ron as they pored over lists of new subjects marking them with checks i just want to give up potions said harry we cant said ron gloomily we keep all our old subjects or idve ditched defense against the dark arts but thats very important said hermione shocked not the way lockhart teaches it said ron i havent learned anything from him except not to set pixies loose neville longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches and wizards in his family all giving him different advice on what to choose confused and worried he sat reading the subject lists with his tongue poking out asking people whether they thought arithmancy sounded more difficult than the study of ancient runes dean thomas who like harry had grown up with muggles ended up closing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list then picking the subjects it landed on hermione took nobodys advice but signed up for everything harry smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what uncle vernon and aunt petunia would say if he tried to discuss his career in wizardry with them not that he didnt get any guidance percy weasley was eager to share his experience depends where you want to go harry he said its never too early to think about the future so id recommend divination people say muggle studies is a soft option but i personally think wizards should have a thorough understanding of the nonmagical community particularly if theyre thinking of working in close contact with them look at my father he has to deal with muggle business all the time my brother charlie was always more of an outdoor type so he went for care of magical creatures play to your strengths harry but the only thing harry felt he was really good at was quidditch in the end he chose the same new subjects as ron feeling that if he was lousy at them at least hed have someone friendly to help him gryffindors next quidditch match would be against hufflepuff wood was insisting on team practices every night after dinner so that harry barely had time for anything but quidditch and homework however the training sessions were getting better or at least drier and the evening before saturdays match he went up to his dormitory to drop off his broomstick feeling gryffindors chances for the quidditch cup had never been better but his cheerful mood didnt last long at the top of the stairs to the dormitory he met neville longbottom who was looking frantic harry i dont know who did it i just found watching harry fearfully neville pushed open the door the contents of harrys trunk had been thrown everywhere his cloak lay ripped on the floor the bedclothes had been pulled off his fourposter and the drawer had been pulled out of his bedside cabinet the contents strewn over the mattress harry walked over to the bed openmouthed treading on a few loose pages of travels with trolls as he and neville pulled the blankets back onto his bed ron dean and seamus came in dean swore loudly what happened harry no idea said harry but ron was examining harrys robes all the pockets were hanging out someones been looking for something said ron is there anything missing harry started to pick up all his things and throw them into his trunk it was only as he threw the last of the lockhart books back into it that he realized what wasnt there riddles diarys gone he said in an undertone to ron what harry jerked his head toward the dormitory door and ron followed him out they hurried down to the gryffindor common room which was halfempty and joined hermione who was sitting alone reading a book called ancient runes made easy hermione looked aghast at the news but only a gryffindor could have stolen nobody else knows our password exactly said harry they woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a light refreshing breeze perfect quidditch conditions said wood enthusiastically at the gryffindor table loading the teams plates with scrambled eggs harry buck up there you need a decent breakfast harry had been staring down the packed gryffindor table wondering if the new owner of riddles diary was right in front of his eyes hermione had been urging him to report the robbery but harry didnt like the idea hed have to tell a teacher all about the diary and how many people knew why hagrid had been expelled fifty years ago he didnt want to be the one who brought it all up again as he left the great hall with ron and hermione to go and collect his quidditch things another very serious worry was added to harrys growing list he had just set foot on the marble staircase when he heard it yet again kill this time let me rip tear he shouted aloud and ron and hermione both jumped away from him in alarm the voice said harry looking over his shoulder i just heard it again didnt you ron shook his head wideeyed hermione however clapped a hand to her forehead harry i think ive just understood something ive got to go to the library and she sprinted away up the stairs what does she understand said harry distractedly still looking around trying to tell where the voice had come from loads more than i do said ron shaking his head but whys she got to go to the library because thats what hermione does said ron shrugging when in doubt go to the library harry stood irresolute trying to catch the voice again but people were now emerging from the great hall behind him talking loudly exiting through the front doors on their way to the quidditch pitch youd better get moving said ron its nearly eleven the match harry raced up to gryffindor tower collected his nimbus two thousand and joined the large crowd swarming across the grounds but his mind was still in the castle along with the bodiless voice and as he pulled on his scarlet robes in the locker room his only comfort was that everyone was now outside to watch the game the teams walked onto the field to tumultuous applause oliver wood took off for a warmup flight around the goal posts madam hooch released the balls the hufflepuffs who played in canary yellow were standing in a huddle having a lastminute discussion of tactics harry was just mounting his broom when professor mcgonagall came half marching half running across the pitch carrying an enormous purple megaphone harrys heart dropped like a stone this match has been cancelled professor mcgonagall called through the megaphone addressing the packed stadium there were boos and shouts oliver wood looking devastated landed and ran toward professor mcgonagall without getting off his broomstick but professor he shouted weve got to play the cup gryffindor professor mcgonagall ignored him and continued to shout through her megaphone all students are to make their way back to the house common rooms where their heads of houses will give them further information as quickly as you can please then she lowered the megaphone and beckoned harry over to her potter i think youd better come with me wondering how she could possibly suspect him this time harry saw ron detach himself from the complaining crowd he came running up to them as they set off toward the castle to harrys surprise professor mcgonagall didnt object yes perhaps youd better come too weasley some of the students swarming around them were grumbling about the match being canceled others looked worried harry and ron followed professor mcgonagall back into the school and up the marble staircase but they werent taken to anybodys office this time this will be a bit of a shock said professor mcgonagall in a surprisingly gentle voice as they approached the infirmary there has been another attack another double attack harrys insides did a horrible somersault professor mcgonagall pushed the door open and he and ron entered madam pomfrey was bending over a fifthyear girl with long curly hair harry recognized her as the ravenclaw theyd accidentally asked for directions to the slytherin common room and on the bed next to her was hermione ron groaned hermione lay utterly still her eyes open and glassy they were found near the library said professor mcgonagall i dont suppose either of you can explain this it was on the floor next to them she was holding up a small circular mirror harry and ron shook their heads both staring at hermione i will escort you back to gryffindor tower said professor mcgonagall heavily i need to address the students in any case all students will return to their house common rooms by six oclock in the evening no student is to leave the dormitories after that time you will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher no student is to use the bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher all further quidditch training and matches are to be postponed there will be no more evening activities the gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to professor mcgonagall in silence she rolled up the parchment from which she had been reading and said in a somewhat choked voice i need hardly add that i have rarely been so distressed it is likely that the school will be closed unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught i would urge anyone who thinks they might know anything about them to come forward she climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait hole and the gryffindors began talking immediately thats two gryffindors down not counting a gryffindor ghost one ravenclaw and one hufflepuff said the weasley twins friend lee jordan counting on his fingers havent any of the teachers noticed that the slytherins are all safe isnt it obvious all this stuffs comingfrom slytherin the heir of slytherin the monster of slytherin why dont they just chuck all the slytherins out he roared to nods and scattered applause percy weasley was sitting in a chair behind lee but for once he didnt seem keen to make his views heard he was looking pale and stunned percys in shock george told harry quietly that ravenclaw girl penelope clearwater shes a prefect i dont think he thought the monster would dare attack a prefect but harry was only halflistening he didnt seem to be able to get rid of the picture of hermione lying on the hospital bed as though carved out of stone and if the culprit wasnt caught soon he was looking at a lifetime back with the dursleys tom riddle had turned hagrid in because he was faced with the prospect of a muggle orphanage if the school closed harry now knew exactly how he had felt whatre we going to do said ron quietly in harrys ear dyou think they suspect hagrid weve got to go and talk to him said harry making up his mind i cant believe its him this time but if he set the monster loose last time hell know how to get inside the chamber of secrets and thats a start but mcgonagall said weve got to stay in our tower unless were in class i think said harry more quietly still its time to get my dads old cloak out again harry had inherited just one thing from his father a long and silvery invisibility cloak it was their only chance of sneaking out of the school to visit hagrid without anyone knowing about it they went to bed at the usual time waited until neville dean and seamus had stopped discussing the chamber of secrets and finally fallen asleep then got up dressed again and threw the cloak over themselves the journey through the dark and deserted castle corridors wasnt enjoyable harry who had wandered the castle at night several times before had never seen it so crowded after sunset teachers prefects and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs staring around for any unusual activity their invisibility cloak didnt stop them making any noise and there was a particularly tense moment when ron stubbed his toe only yards from the spot where snape stood standing guard thankfully snape sneezed at almost exactly the moment ron swore it was with relief that they reached the oak front doors and eased them open it was a clear starry night they hurried toward the lit windows of hagrids house and pulled off the cloak only when they were right outside his front door seconds after they had knocked hagrid flung it open they found themselves facetoface with him aiming a crossbow at them fang the boarhound barked loudly behind him oh he said lowering the weapon and staring at them whatre you two doin here whats that for said harry pointing at the crossbow as they stepped inside nothin nothin hagrid muttered ive bin expectin doesn matter sit down ill make tea he hardly seemed to know what he was doing he nearly extinguished the fire spilling water from the kettle on it and then smashed the teapot with a nervous jerk of his massive hand are you okay hagrid said harry did you hear about hermione oh i heard all righ said hagrid a slight break in his voice he kept glancing nervously at the windows he poured them both large mugs of boiling water he had forgotten to add tea bags and was just putting a slab of fruitcake on a plate when there was a loud knock on the door hagrid dropped the fruitcake harry and ron exchanged panicstricken looks then threw the invisibility cloak back over themselves and retreated into a corner hagrid checked that they were hidden seized his crossbow and flung open his door once more good evening hagrid it was dumbledore he entered looking deadly serious and was followed by a second very oddlooking man the stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious expression and was wearing a strange mixture of clothes a pinstriped suit a scarlet tie a long black cloak and pointed purple boots under his arm he carried a limegreen bowler thats dads boss ron breathed cornelius fudge the minister of magic harry elbowed ron hard to make him shut up hagrid had gone pale and sweaty he dropped into one of his chairs and looked from dumbledore to cornelius fudge bad business hagrid said fudge in rather clipped tones very bad business had to come four attacks on muggleborns thingsve gone far enough ministrys got to act i never said hagrid looking imploringly at dumbledore you know i never professor dumbledore sir i want it understood cornelius that hagrid has my full confidence said dumbledore frowning at fudge look albus said fudge uncomfortably hagrids records against him ministrys got to do something the school governors have been in touch yet again cornelius i tell you that taking hagrid away will not help in the slightest said dumbledore his blue eyes were full of a fire harry had never seen before look at it from my point of view said fudge fidgeting with his bowler im under a lot of pressure got to be seen to be doing something if it turns out it wasnt hagrid hell be back and no more said but ive got to take him got to wouldnt be doing my duty take me said hagrid who was trembling take me where for a short stretch only said fudge not meeting hagrids eyes not a punishment hagrid more a precaution if someone else is caught youll be let out with a full apology not azkaban croaked hagrid before fudge could answer there was another loud rap on the door dumbledore answered it it was harrys turn for an elbow in the ribs hed let out an audible gasp mr lucius malfoy strode into hagrids hut swathed in a long black traveling cloak smiling a cold and satisfied smile fang started to growl already here fudge he said approvingly good good whatre you doin here said hagrid furiously get outta my house my dear man please believe me i have no pleasure at all in being inside your er dyou call this a house said lucius malfoy sneering as he looked around the small cabin i simply called at the school and was told that the headmaster was here and what exactly did you want with me lucius said dumbledore he spoke politely but the fire was still blazing in his blue eyes dreadful thing dumbledore said malfoy lazily taking out a long roll of parchment but the governors feel its time for you to step aside this is an order of suspension youll find all twelve signatures on it im afraid we feel youre losing your touch how many attacks have there been now two more this afternoon wasnt it at this rate therell be no muggleborns left at hogwarts and we all know what an awful loss that would be to the school oh now see here lucius said fudge looking alarmed dumbledore suspended no no last thing we want just now the appointment or suspension of the headmaster is a matter for the governors fudge said mr malfoy smoothly and as dumbledore has failed to stop these attacks see here malfoy if dumbledore cant stop them said fudge whose upper lip was sweating now i mean to say who can that remains to be seen said mr malfoy with a nasty smile but as all twelve of us have voted hagrid leapt to his feet his shaggy black head grazing the ceiling an how many did yeh have ter threaten an blackmail before they agreed malfoy eh he roared dear dear you know that temper of yours will lead you into trouble one of these days hagrid said mr malfoy i would advise you not to shout at the azkaban guards like that they wont like it at all yeh can take dumbledore yelled hagrid making fang the boarhound cower and whimper in his basket take him away an the muggleborns won stand a chance therell be killin next calm yourself hagrid said dumbledore sharply he looked at lucius malfoy if the governors want my removal lucius i shall of course step aside but stuttered fudge nogrowled hagrid dumbledore had not taken his bright blue eyes off lucius malfoys cold gray ones however said dumbledore speaking very slowly and clearly so that none of them could miss a word you will find that i will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me you will also find that help will always be given at hogwarts to those who ask for it for a second harry was almost sure dumbledores eyes flickered toward the corner where he and ron stood hidden admirable sentiments said malfoy bowing we shall all miss your er highly individual way of running things albus and only hope that your successor will manage to prevent any more ah killins he strode to the cabin door opened it and bowed dumbledore out fudge fiddling with his bowler waited for hagrid to go ahead of him but hagrid stood his ground took a deep breath and said carefully if anyone wanted ter find out some stuff all theyd have ter do would be ter follow the spiders thatd lead em right thats all im sayin fudge stared at him in amazement all right im commin said hagrid pulling on his moleskin overcoat but as he was about to follow fudge through the door he stopped again and said loudly an someonell need ter feed fang while im away the door banged shut and ron pulled off the invisability cloak were in trouble now he said hoarsely no dumbledore they might as well close the school tonight therell be an attack a day with him gone fang started howling scratching at the closed door chapter fifteen aragog summer was creeping over the grounds around the castle sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the greenhouses but with no hagrid visible from the castle windows striding the grounds with fang at his heels the scene didnt look right to harry no better in fact than the inside of the castle where things were so horribly wrong harry and ron had tried to visit hermione but visitors were now barred from the hospital wing were taking no more chances madam pomfrey told them severely through a crack in the infirmary door no im sorry theres every chance the attacker might come back to finish these people off with dumbledore gone fear had spread as never before so that the sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows there was barely a face to be seen in the school that didnt look worried and tense and any laughter that rang through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled harry constantly repeated dumbledores final words to himself i will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me help will always be given at hogwarts to those who ask for it but what good were these words who exactly were they supposed to ask for help when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were hagrids hint about the spiders was far easier to understand the trouble was there didnt seem to be a single spider left in the castle to follow harry looked everywhere he went helped rather reluctantly by ron they were hampered of course by the fact that they werent allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle in a pack with the other gryffindors most of their fellow students seemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class by teachers but harry found it very irksome one person however seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the atmosphere of terror and suspicion draco malfoy was strutting around the school as though he had just been appointed head boy harry didnt realize what he was so pleased about until the potions lesson about two weeks after dumbledore and hagrid had left when sitting right behind malfoy harry overheard him gloating to crabbe and goyle i always thought father might be the one who got rid of dumbledore he said not troubling to keep his voice down i told you he thinks dumbledores the worst headmaster the schools ever had maybe well get a decent headmaster now someone who wont want the chamber of secrets closed mcgonagall wont last long shes only filling in snape swept past harry making no comment about hermiones empty seat and cauldron sir said malfoy loudly sir why dont you apply for the headmasters job now now malfoy said snape though he couldnt suppress a thinlipped smile professor dumbledore has only been suspended by the governors i daresay hell be back with us soon enough yeah right said malfoy smirking i expect youd have fathers vote sir if you wanted to apply for the job ill tell father youre the best teacher here sir snape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon fortunately not spotting seamus finnigan who was pretending to vomit into his cauldron im quite surprised the mudbloods havent all packed their bags by now malfoy went on bet you five galleons the next one dies pity it wasnt granger the bell rang at that moment which was lucky at malfoys last words ron had leapt off his stool and in the scramble to collect bags and books his attempts to reach malfoy went unnoticed let me at him ron growled as harry and dean hung onto his arms i dont care i dont need my wand im going to kill him with my bare hands hurry up ive got to take you all to herbology barked snape over the classs heads and off they marched with harry ron and dean bringing up the rear ron still trying to get loose it was only safe to let go of him when snape had seen them out of the castle and they were making their way across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses the herbology class was very subdued there were now two missing from their number justin and hermione professor sprout set them all to work pruning the abyssinian shrivelfigs harry went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the compost heap and found himself facetoface with ernie macmillan ernie took a deep breath and said very formally i just want to say harry that im sorry i ever suspected you i know youd never attack hermione granger and i apologize for all the stuff i said were all in the same boat now and well he held out a pudgy hand and harry shook it ernie and his friend hannah came to work at the same shrivelfig as harry and ron that draco malfoy character said ernie breaking off dead twigs he seems very pleased about all this doesnt he dyou know i think he might be slytherins heir thats clever of you said ron who didnt seem to have forgiven ernie as readily as harry do you think its malfoy harry ernie asked no said harry so firmly that ernie and hannah stared a second later harry spotted something several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side of the glass moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking the shortest route to a prearranged meeting harry hit ron over the hand with his pruning shears ouch whatre you harry pointed out the spiders following their progress with his eyes screwed up against the sun oh yeah said ron trying and failing to look pleased but we cant follow them now ernie and hannah were listening curiously harrys eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders if they pursued their fixed course there could be no doubt about where they would end up looks like theyre heading for the forbidden forest and ron looked even unhappier about that at the end of the lesson professor sprout escorted the class to their defense against the dark arts lesson harry and ron lagged behind the others so they could talk out of earshot well have to use the invisibility cloak again harry told ron we can take fang with us hes used to going into the forest with hagrid he might be some help right said ron who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingers er arent there arent there supposed to be werewolves in the forest he added as they took their usual places at the back of lockharts classroom preferring not to answer that question harry said there are good things in there too the centaurs are all right and the unicorns ron had never been into the forbidden forest before harry had entered it only once and had hoped never to do so again lockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at him every other teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual but lockhart appeared nothing short of buoyant come now he cried beaming around him why all these long faces people swapped exasperated looks but nobody answered dont you people realize said lockhart speaking slowly as though they were all a bit dim the danger has passed the culprit has been taken away says who said dean thomas loudly my dear young man the minister of magic wouldnt have taken hagrid if he hadnt been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty said lockhart in the tone of someone explaining that one and one made two oh yes he would said ron even more loudly than dean i flatter myself i know a touch more about hagrids arrest than you do mr weasley said lockhart in a selfsatisfied tone ron started to say that he didnt think so somehow but stopped in midsentence when harry kicked him hard under the desk we werent there remember harry muttered but lockharts disgusting cheeriness his hints that he had always thought hagrid was no good his confidence that the whole business was now at an end irritated harry so much that he yearned to throw gadding with ghouls right in lockharts stupid face instead he contented himself with scrawling a note to ron lets do it tonight ron read the message swallowed hard and looked sideways at the empty seat usually filled by hermione the sight seemed to stiffen his resolve and he nodded the gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days because from six oclock onward the gryffindors had nowhere else to go they also had plenty to talk about with the result that the common room often didnt empty until past midnight harry went to get the invisibility cloak out of his trunk right after dinner and spent the evening sitting on it waiting for the room to clear fred and george challenged harry and ron to a few games of exploding snap and ginny sat watching them very subdued in hermiones usual chair harry and ron kept losing on purpose trying to finish the games quickly but even so it was well past midnight when fred george and ginny finally went to bed harry and ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak throwing it over themselves and climbing through the portrait hole it was another difficult journey through the castle dodging all the teachers at last they reached the entrance hall slid back the lock on the oak front doors squeezed between them trying to stop any creaking and stepped out into the moonlit grounds course said ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass we might get to the forest and find theres nothing to follow those spiders might notve been going there at all i know it looked like they were moving in that sort of general direction but his voice trailed away hopefully they reached hagrids house sad and sorrylooking with its blank windows when harry pushed the door open fang went mad with joy at the sight of them worried he might wake everyone at the castle with his deep booming barks they hastily fed him treacle fudge from a tin on the mantelpiece which glued his teeth together harry left the invisibility cloak on hagrids table there would be no need for it in the pitchdark forest cmon fang were going for a walk said harry patting his leg and fang bounded happily out of the house behind them dashed to the edge of the forest and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree harry took out his wand murmured lumos and a tiny light appeared at the end of it just enough to let them watch the path for signs of spiders good thinking said ron id light mine too but you know itd probably blow up or something harry tapped ron on the shoulder pointing at the grass two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees okay ron sighed as though resigned to the worst im ready lets go so with fang scampering around them sniffing tree roots and leaves they entered the forest by the glow of harrys wand they followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path they walked behind them for about twenty minutes not speaking listening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves then when the trees had become thicker than ever so that the stars overhead were no longer visible and harrys wand shone alone in the sea of dark they saw their spider guides leaving the path harry paused trying to see where the spiders were going but everything outside his little sphere of light was pitchblack he had never been this deep into the forest before he could vividly remember hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time hed been in here but hagrid was miles away now probably sitting in a cell in azkaban and he had also said to follow the spiders something wet touched harrys hand and he jumped backward crushing rods foot but it was only fangs nose what dyou reckon harry said to ron whose eyes he could just make out reflecting the light from his wand weve come this far said ron so they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees they couldnt move very quickly now there were tree roots and stumps in their way barely visible in the near blackness harry could feel fangs hot breath on his hand more than once they had to stop so that harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight they walked for what seemed like at least half an hour their robes snagging on lowslung branches and brambles after a while they noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward though the trees were as thick as ever then fang suddenly let loose a great echoing bark making both harry and ron jump out of their skins what said ron loudly looking around into the pitchdark and gripping harrys elbow very hard theres something moving over there harry breathed listen sounds like something big they listened some distance to their right the something big was snapping branches as it carved a path through the trees oh no said ron oh no oh no oh shut up said harry frantically itll hear you hear me said ron in an unnaturally high voice its already heard fang the darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they stood terrified waiting there was a strange rumbling noise and then silence what dyou think its doing said harry probably getting ready to pounce said ron they waited shivering hardly daring to move dyou think its gone harry whispered dunno then to their right came a sudden blaze of light so bright in the darkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes fang yelped and tried to run but got lodged in a tangle of thorns and yelped even louder harry ron shouted his voice breaking with relief harry its our car what come on harry blundered after ron toward the light stumbling and tripping and a moment later they had emerged into a clearing mr weasleys car was standing empty in the middle of a circle of thick trees under a roof of dense branches its headlights ablaze as ron walked open mouthed toward it it moved slowly toward him exactly like a large turquoise dog greeting its owner its been here all the time said ron delightedly walking around the car look at it the forests turned it wild the sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud apparently it had taken to trundling around the forest on its own fang didnt seem at all keen on it he kept close to harry who could feel him quivering his breathing slowing down again harry stuffed his wand back into his robes and we thought it was going to attack us said ron leaning against the car and patting it i wondered where it had gone harry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spiders but they had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlights weve lost the trail he said cmon lets go and find them ron didnt speak he didnt move his eyes were fixed on a point some ten feet above the forest floor right behind harry his face was livid with terror harry didnt even have time to turn around there was a loud clicking noise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him around the middle and lift him off the ground so that he was hanging facedown struggling terrified he heard more clicking and saw rons legs leave the ground too heard fang whimpering and howling next moment he was being swept away into the dark trees head hanging harry saw that what had hold of him was marching on six immensely long hairy legs the front two clutching him tightly below a pair of shining black pincers behind him he could hear another of the creatures no doubt carrying ron they were moving into the very heart of the forest harry could hear fang fighting to free himself from a third monster whining loudly but harry couldnt have yelled even if he had wanted to he seemed to have left his voice back with the car in the clearing he never knew how long he was in the creatures clutches he only knew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that the leafstrewn ground was now swarming with spiders craning his neck sideways he realized that they had reached the ridge of a vast hollow a hollow that had been cleared of trees so that the stars shone brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes on spiders not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below spiders the size of carthorses eighteyed eightlegged black hairy gigantic the massive specimen that was carrying harry made its way down the steep slope toward a misty domed web in the very center of the hollow while its fellows closed in all around it clicking their pincers excitedly at the sight of its load harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him ron and fang thudded down next to him fang wasnt howling anymore but cowering silently on the spot ron looked exactly like harry felt his mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyes were popping harry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was saying something it had been hard to tell because he clicked his pincers with every word he spoke aragog it called aragog and from the middle of the misty domed web a spider the size of a small elephant emerged very slowly there was gray in the black of his body and legs and each of the eyes on his ugly pincered head was milky white he was blind what is it he said clicking his pincers rapidly men clicked the spider who had caught harry is it hagrid said aragog moving closer his eight milky eyes wandering vaguely strangers clicked the spider who had brought ron kill them clicked aragog fretfully i was sleeping were friends of hagrids harry shouted his heart seemed to have left his chest to pound in his throat click click click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow aragog paused hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before he said slowly hagrids in trouble said harry breathing very fast thats why weve come in trouble said the aged spider and harry thought he heard concern beneath the clicking pincers but why has he sent you harry thought of getting to his feet but decided against it he didnt think his legs would support him so he spoke from the ground as calmly as he could they think up at the school that hagrids been setting a a something on students theyve taken him to azkaban aragog clicked his pincers furiously and all around the hollow the sound was echoed by the crowd of spiders it was like applause except applause didnt usually make harry feel sick with fear but that was years ago said aragog fretfully years and years ago i remember it well thats why they made him leave the school they believed that i was the monster that dwells in what they call the chamber of secrets they thought that hagrid had opened the chamber and set me free and you you didnt come from the chamber of secrets said harry who could feel cold sweat on his forehead i said aragog clicking angrily i was not born in the castle i come from a distant land a traveler gave me to hagrid when i was an egg hagrid was only a boy but he cared for me hidden in a cupboard in the castle feeding me on scraps from the table hagrid is my good friend and a good man when i was discovered and blamed for the death of a girl he protected me i have lived here in the forest ever since where hagrid still visits me he even found me a wife mosag and you see how our family has grown all through hagrids goodness harry summoned what remained of his courage so you never never attacked anyone never croaked the old spider it would have been my instinct but out of respect for hagrid i never harmed a human the body of the girl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom i never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which i grew up our kind like the dark and the quiet but then do you know what did kill that girl said harry because whatever it is its back and attacking people again his words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and the rustling of many long legs shifting angrily large black shapes shifted all around him the thing that lives in the castle said aragog is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others well do i remember how i pleaded with hagrid to let me go when i sensed the beast moving about the school what is it said harry urgently more loud clicking more rustling the spiders seemed to be closing in we do not speak of it said aragog fiercely we do not name it i never even told hagrid the name of that dread creature though he asked me many times harry didnt want to press the subject not with the spiders pressing closer on all sides aragog seemed to be tired of tamng he was backing slowly into his domed web but his fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward harry and ron well just go then harry called desperately to aragog hearing leaves rustling behind him go said aragog slowly i think not but but my sons and daughters do not harm hagrid on my command but i cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst goodbye friend of hagrid harry spun around feet away towering above him was a solid wall of spiders clicking their many eyes gleaming in their ugly black heads even as he reached for his wand harry knew it was no good there were too many of them but as he tried to stand ready to die fighting a loud long note sounded and a blaze of light flamed through the hollow mr weasleys car was thundering down the slope headlights glaring its horn screeching knocking spiders aside several were thrown onto their backs their endless legs waving in the air the car screeched to a halt in front of harry and ron and the doors flew open get fang harry yelled diving into the front seat ron seized the boarhound around the middle and threw him yelping into the back of the car the doors slammed shut ron didnt touch the accelerator but the car didnt need him the engine roared and they were off hitting more spiders they sped up the slope out of the hollow and they were soon crashing through the forest branches whipping the windows as the car wound its way cleverly through the widest gaps following a path it obviously knew harry looked sideways at ron his mouth was still open in the silent scream but his eyes werent popping anymore are you okay ron stared straight ahead unable to speak they smashed their way through the undergrowth fang howling loudly in the back seat and harry saw the side mirror snap off as they squeezed past a large oak after ten noisy rocky minutes the trees thinned and harry could again see patches of sky the car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into the windshield they had reached the edge of the forest fang flung himself at the window in his anxiety to get out and when harry opened the door he shot off through the trees to hagrids house tail between his legs harry got out too and after a minute or so ron seemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and followed still stiffnecked and staring harry gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back into the forest and disappeared from view harry went back into hagrids cabin to get the invisibility cloak fang was trembling under a blanket in his basket when harry got outside again he found ron being violently sick in the pumpkin patch follow the spiders said ron weakly wiping his mouth on his sleeve ill never forgive hagrid were lucky to be alive i bet he thought aragog wouldnt hurt friends of his said harry thats exactly hagrids problem said ron thumping the wall of the cabin he always thinks monsters arent as bad as theyre made out and look where its got him a cell in azkaban he was shivering uncontrollably now what was the point of sending us in there what have we found out id like to know that hagrid never opened the chamber of secrets said harry throwing the cloak over ron and prodding him in the arm to make him walk he was innocent ron gave a loud snort evidently hatching aragog in a cupboard wasnt his idea of being innocent as the castle loomed nearer harry twitched the cloak to make sure their feet were hidden then pushed the creaking front doors ajar they walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up the marble staircase holding their breath as they passed corridors where watchful sentries were walking at last they reached the safety of the gryffindor common room where the fire had burned itself into glowing ash they took off the cloak and climbed the winding stair to their dormitory ron fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed harry however didnt feel very sleepy he sat on the edge of his fourposter thinking hard about everything aragog had said the creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle he thought sounded like a sort of monster voldemort even other monsters didnt want to name it but he and ron were no closer to finding out what it was or how it petrified its victims even hagrid had never known what was in the chamber of secrets harry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his pillows watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window he couldnt see what else they could do they had hit dead ends everywhere riddle had caught the wrong person the heir of slytherin had got off and no one could tell whether it was the same person or a different one who had opened the chamber this time there was nobody else to ask harry lay down still thinking about what aragog had said he was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last hope occurred to him and he suddenly sat bolt upright ron he hissed through the dark ron ron woke with a yelp like fangs stared wildly around and saw harry ron that girl who died aragog said she was found in a bathroom said harry ignoring nevilles snufing snores from the corner what if she never left the bathroom what if shes still there ron rubbed his eyes frowning through the moonlight and then he understood too you dont think not moaning myrtle chapter sixteen the chamber of secrets all those times we were in that bathroom and she was just three toilets away said ron bitterly at breakfast next day and we couldve asked her and now it had been hard enough trying to look for spiders escaping their teachers long enough to sneak into a girls bathroom the girls bathroom moreover right next to the scene of the first attack was going to be almost impossible but something happened in their first lesson transfiguration that drove the chamber of secrets out of their minds for the first time in weeks ten minutes into the class professor mcgonagall told them that their exams would start on the first of june one week from today exams howled seamus finnigan were still getting exams there was a loud bang behind harry as neville longbottoms wand slipped vanishing one of the legs on his desk professor mcgonagall restored it with a wave of her own wand and turned frowning to seamus the whole point of keeping the school open at this time is for you to receive your education she said sternly the exams will therefore take place as usual and i trust you are all studying hard studying hard it had never occurred to harry that there would be exams with the castle in this state there was a great deal of mutinous muttering around the room which made professor mcgonagall scowl even more darkly professor dumbledores instructions were to keep the school running as normally as possible she said and that i need hardly point out means finding out how much you have learned this year harry looked down at the pair of white rabbits he was supposed to be turning into slippers what had he learned so far this year he couldnt seem to think of anything that would be useful in an exam ron looked as though hed just been told he had to go and live in the forbidden forest can you imagine me taking exams with this he asked harry holding up his wand which had just started whistling loudly three days before their first exam professor mcgonagall made another announcement at breakfast i have good news she said and the great hall instead of falling silent erupted dumbledores coming back several people yelled joyfully youve caught the heir of slytherin squealed a girl at the ravenclaw table quidditch matches are back on roared wood excitedly when the hubbub had subsided professor mcgonagall said professor sprout has informed me that the mandrakes are ready for cutting at last tonight we will be able to revive those people who have been petrified i need hardly remind you all that one of them may well be able to tell us who or what attacked them i am hopeful that this dreadful year will end with our catching the culprit there was an explosion of cheering harry looked over at the slytherin table and wasnt at all surprised to see that draco malfoy hadnt joined in ron however was looking happier than hed looked in days it wont matter that we never asked myrtle then he said to harry hermionell probably have all the answers when they wake her up mind you shell go crazy when she finds out weve got exams in three days time she hasnt studied it might be kinder to leave her where she is till theyre over just then ginny weasley came over and sat down next to ron she looked tense and nervous and harry noticed that her hands were twisting in her lap whats up said ron helping himself to more porridge ginny didnt say anything but glanced up and down the gryffindor table with a scared look on her face that reminded harry of someone though he couldnt think who spit it out said ron watching her harry suddenly realized who ginny looked like she was rocking backward and forward slightly in her chair exactly like dobby did when he was teetering on the edge of revealing forbidden information ive got to tell you something ginny mumbled carefully not looking at harry what is it said harry ginny looked as though she couldnt find the right words whatsaid ron ginny opened her mouth but no sound came out harry leaned forward and spoke quietly so that only ginny and ron could hear him is it something about the chamber of secrets have you seen something someone acting oddly ginny drew a deep breath and at that precise moment percy weasley appeared looking tired and wan if youve finished eating ill take that seat ginny im starving ive only just come off patrol duty ginny jumped up as though her chair had just been electrified gave percy a fleeting frightened look and scampered away percy sat down and grabbed a mug from the center of the table percy said ron angrily she was just about to tell us something important halfway through a gulp of tea percy choked what sort of thing he said coughing i just asked her if shed seen anything odd and she started to say oh that thats nothing to do with the chamber of secrets said percy at once how do you know said ron his eyebrows raised well er if you must know ginny er walked in on me the other day when i was well never mind the point is she spotted me doing something and i um i asked her not to mention it to anybody i must say i did think shed keep her word its nothing really id just rather harry had never seen percy look so uncomfortable what were you doing percy said ron grinning go on tell us we wont laugh percy didnt smile back pass me those rolls harry im starving harry knew the whole mystery might be solved tomorrow without their help but he wasnt about to pass up a chance to speak to myrtle if it turned up and to his delight it did midmorning when they were being led to history of magic by gilderoy lockhart lockhart who had so often assured them that all danger had passed only to be proved wrong right away was now wholeheartedly convinced that it was hardly worth the trouble to see them safely down the corridors his hair wasnt as sleek as usual it seemed he had been up most of the night patrolling the fourth floor mark my words he said ushering them around a corner the first words out of those poor petrified peoples mouths will be it was hagrid frankly im astounded professor mcgonagall thinks all these security measures are necessary i quite agree sir said harry making ron drop his books in surprise thank you harry said lockhart graciously while they waited for a long line of hufflepuffs to pass i mean we teachers have quite enough to be getting on with without walking students to classes and standing guard all night thats right said ron catching on why dont you leave us here sir weve only got one more corridor to go you know weasley i think i will said lockhart i really should go and prepare my next class and he hurried off prepare his class ron sneered after him gone to curl his hair more like they let the rest of the gryffindors draw ahead of them then darted down a side passage and hurried off toward moaning myrtles bathroom but just as they were congratulating each other on their brilliant scheme potter weasley what are you doing it was professor mcgonagall and her mouth was the thinnest of thin lines we were we were ron stammered we were going to to go and see hermione said harry ron and professor mcgonagall both looked at him we havent seen her for ages professor harry went on hurriedly treading on rons foot and we thought wed sneak into the hospital wing you know and tell her the mandrakes are nearly ready and er not to worry professor mcgonagall was still staring at him and for a moment harry thought she was going to explode but when she spoke it was in a strangely croaky voice of course she said and harry amazed saw a tear glistening in her beady eye of course i realize this has all been hardest on the friends of those who have been i quite understand yes potter of course you may visit miss granger i will inform professor binns where youve gone tell madam pomfrey i have given my permission harry and ron walked away hardly daring to believe that theyd avoided detention as they turned the corner they distinctly heard professor mcgonagall blow her nose that said ron fervently was the best story youve ever come up with they had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing and tell madam pomfrey that they had professor mcgonagalls permission to visit hermione madam pomfrey let them in but reluctantly theres just no point talking to a petrified person she said and they had to admit she had a point when theyd taken their seats next to hermione it was plain that hermione didnt have the faintest inkling that she had visitors and that they might just as well tell her bedside cabinet not to worry for all the good it would do wonder if she did see the attacker though said ron looking sadly at hermiones rigid face because if he sneaked up on them all no onell ever know but harry wasnt looking at hermiones face he was more interested in her right hand it lay clenched on top of her blankets and bending closer he saw that a piece of paper was scrunched inside her fist making sure that madam pomfrey was nowhere near he pointed this out to ron try and get it out ron whispered shifting his chair so that he blocked harry from madam pomfreys view it was no easy task hermiones hand was clamped so tightly around the paper that harry was sure he was going to tear it while ron kept watch he tugged and twisted and at last after several tense minutes the paper came free it was a page torn from a very old library book harry smoothed it out eagerly and ron leaned close to read it too of the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land there is none more curious or more deadly than the basilisk known also as the king of serpents this snake which may reach gigantic size and live many hundreds of years is born from a chickens egg hatched beneath a toad its methods of killing are most wondrous for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs the basilisk has a murderous stare and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall suffer instant death spiders flee before the basilisk for it is their mortal enemy and the basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster which is fatal to it and beneath this a single word had been written in a hand harry recognized as hermiones pipes it was as though somebody had just flicked a light on in his brain ron he breathed this is it this is the answer the monster in the chambers a basilisk a giant serpent that why ive been hearing that voice all over the place and nobody else has heard it its because i understand parseltongue harry looked up at the beds around him the basilisk kills people by looking at them but no ones died because no one looked it straight in the eye colin saw it through his camera the basilisk burned up all the film inside it but colin just got petrified justin justin mustve seen the basilisk through nearly headless nick nick got the full blast of it but he couldnt die again and hermione and that ravenclaw prefect were found with a mirror next to them hermione had just realized the monster was a basilisk i bet you anything she warned the first person she met to look around corners with a mirror first and that girl pulled out her mirror and rods jaw had dropped and mrs norris he whispered eagerly harry thought hard picturing the scene on the night of halloween the water he said slowly the flood from moaning myrtles bathroom i bet you mrs norris only saw the reflection he scanned the page in his hand eagerly the more he looked at it the more it made sense the crowing of the rooster is fatal to it he read aloud hagrids roosters were killed the heir of slytherin didnt want one anywhere near the castle once the chamber was opened spidersflee before it it all fits but hows the basilisk been getting around the place said ron a giant snake someone wouldve seen harry however pointed at the word hermione had scribbled at the foot of the page pipes he said pipes ron its been using the plumbing ive been hearing that voice inside the walls ron suddenly grabbed harrys arm the entrance to the chamber of secrets he said hoarsely what if its a bathroom what if its in moaning myrtles bathroom said harry they sat there excitement coursing through them hardly able to believe it this means said harry i cant be the only parselmouth in the school the heir of slytherins one too thats how hes been controlling the basilisk whatre we going to do said ron whose eyes were flashing should we go straight to mcgonagall lets go to the staff room said harry jumping up shell be there in ten minutes its nearly break they ran downstairs not wanting to be discovered hanging around in another corridor they went straight into the deserted staff room it was a large paneled room full of dark wooden chairs harry and ron paced around it too excited to sit down but the bell to signal break never came instead echoing through the corridors came professor mcgonagalls voice magically magnified all students to return to their house dormitories at once all teachers return to the staff room immediately please harry wheeled around to stare at ron not another attack not now whatll we do said ron aghast go back to the dormitory no said harry glancing around there was an ugly sort of wardrobe to his left full of the teachers cloaks in here lets hear what its all about then we can tell them what weve found out they hid themselves inside it listening to the rumbling of hundreds of people moving overhead and the staff room door banging open from between the musty folds of the cloaks they watched the teachers filtering into the room some of them were looking puzzled others downright scared then professor mcgonagall arrived it has happened she told the silent staff room a student has been taken by the monster right into the chamber itself professor flitwick let out a squeal professor sprout clapped her hands over her mouth snape gripped the back of a chair very hard and said how can you be sure the heir of slytherin said professor mcgonagall who was very white left another message right underneath the first one her skeleton will lie in the chamber forever professor flitwick burst into tears who is it said madam hooch who had sunk weakkneed into a chair which student ginny weasley said professor mcgonagall harry felt ron slide silently down onto the wardrobe floor beside him we shall have to send all the students home tomorrow said professor mcgonagall this is the end of hogwarts dumbledore always said the staffroom door banged open again for one wild moment harry was sure it would be dumbledore but it was lockhart and he was beaming so sorry dozed off what have i missed he didnt seem to notice that the other teachers were looking at him with something remarkably like hatred snape stepped forward just the man he said the very man a girl has been snatched by the monster lockhart taken into the chamber of secrets itself your moment has come at last lockhart blanched thats right gilderoy chipped in professor sprout werent you saying just last night that youve known all along where the entrance to the chamber of secrets is i well i sputtered lockhart yes didnt you tell me you were sure you knew what was inside it piped up professor flitwick ddid i i dont recall i certainly remember you saying you were sorry you hadnt had a crack at the monster before hagrid was arrested said snape didnt you say that the whole affair had been bungled and that you should have been given a free rein from the first lockhart stared around at his stonyfaced colleagues i i really never you may have misunderstood well leave it to you then gilderoy said professor mcgonagall tonight will be an excellent time to do it well make sure everyones out of your way youll be able to tackle the monster all by youself a free rein at last lockhart gazed desperately around him but nobody came to the rescue he didnt look remotely handsome anymore his lip was trembling and in the absence of his usually toothy grin he looked weakchinned and feeble v very well he said ill ill be in my office getting getting ready and he left the room right said professor mcgonagall whose nostrils were flared thats got him out from under our feet the heads of houses should go and inform their students what has happened tell them the hogwarts express will take them home first thing tomorrow will the rest of you please make sure no students have been left outside their dormitories the teachers rose and left one by one it was probably the worst day of harrys entire life he ron fred and george sat together in a corner of the gryffindor common room unable to say anything to each other percy wasnt there he had gone to send an owl to mr and mrs weasley then shut himself up in his dormitory no afternoon ever lasted as long as that one nor had gryffindor tower ever been so crowded yet so quiet near sunset fred and george went up to bed unable to sit there any longer she knew something harry said ron speaking for the first time since they had entered the wardrobe in the staff room thats why she was taken it wasnt some stupid thing about percy at all shed found out something about the chamber of secrets that must be why she was ron rubbed his eyes frantically i mean she was a pureblood there cant be any other reason harry could see the sun sinking bloodred below the skyline this was the worst he had ever felt if only there was something they could do anything harry said ron dyou think theres any chance at all shes not you know harry didnt know what to say he couldnt see how ginny could still be alive dyou know what said ron i think we should go and see lockhart tell him what we know hes going to try and get into the chamber we can tell him where we think it is and tell him its a basilisk in there because harry couldnt think of anything else to do and because he wanted to be doing something he agreed the gryffindors around them were so miserable and felt so sorry for the weasleys that nobody tried to stop them as they got up crossed the room and left through the portrait hole darkness was falling as they walked down to lockharts office there seemed to be a lot of activity going on inside it they could hear scraping thumps and hurried footsteps harry knocked and there was a sudden silence from inside then the door opened the tiniest crack and they saw one of lockharts eyes peering through it oh mr potter mr weasley he said opening the door a bit wider im rather busy at the moment if you would be quick professor weve got some information for you said harry we think itll help you er well its not terribly the side of lockharts face that they could see looked very uncomfortable i mean well all right he opened the door and they entered his office had been almost completely stripped two large trunks stood open on the floor robes jadegreen lilac midnightblue had been hastily folded into one of them books were jumbled untidily into the other the photographs that had covered the walls were now crammed into boxes on the desk are you going somewhere said harry er well yes said lockhart ripping a lifesize poster of himself from the back of the door as he spoke and starting to roll it up urgent call unavoidable got to go what about my sister said ron jerkily well as to that most unfortunate said lockhart avoiding their eyes as he wrenched open a drawer and started emptying the contents into a bag no one regrets more than i youre the defense against the dark arts teacher said harry you cant go now not with all the dark stuff going on here well i must say when i took the job lockhart muttered now piling socks on top of his robes nothing in the job description didnt expect you mean youre running away said harry disbelievingly after all that stuff you did in your books books can be misleading said lockhart delicately you wrote them harry shouted my dear boy said lockhart straightening up and frowning at harry do use your common sense my books wouldnt have sold half as well if people didnt think id done all those things no one wants to read about some ugly old armenian warlock even if he did save a village from werewolves hed look dreadful on the front cover no dress sense at all and the witch who banished the bandon banshee had a harelip i mean come on so youve just been taking credit for what a load of other people have done said harry incredulously harry harry said lockhart shaking his head impatiently its not nearly as simple as that there was work involved i had to track these people down ask them exactly how they managed to do what they did then i had to put a memory charm on them so they wouldnt remember doing it if theres one thing i pride myself on its my memory charms no its been a lot of work harry its not all book signings and publicity photos you know you want fame you have to be prepared for a long hard slog he banged the lids of his trunks shut and locked them lets see he said i think thats everything yes only one thing left he pulled out his wand and turned to them awfully sorry boys but ill have to put a memory charm on you now cant have you blabbing my secrets all over the place id never sell another book harry reached his wand just in time lockhart had barely raised his when harry bellowed expelliarmus lockhart was blasted backward falling over his trunk his wand flew high into the air ron caught it and flung it out of the open window shouldnt have let professor snape teach us that one said harry furiously kicking lockharts trunk aside lockhart was looking up at him feeble once more harry was still pointing his wand at him what dyou want me to do said lockhart weakly i dont know where the chamber of secrets is theres nothing i can do youre in luck said harry forcing lockhart to his feet at wandpoint we think we know where it is and whats inside it lets go they marched lockhart out of his office and down the nearest stairs along the dark corridor where the messages shone on the wall to the door of moaning myrtles bathroom they sent lockhart in first harry was pleased to see that he was shaking moaning myrtle was sitting on the tank of the end toilet oh its you she said when she saw harry what do you want this time to ask you how you died said harry myrtles whole aspect changed at once she looked as though she had never been asked such a flattering question ooooh it was dreadful she said with relish it happened right in here i died in this very stall i remember it so well id hidden because olive hornby was teasing me about my glasses the door was locked and i was crying and then i heard somebody come in they said something funny a different language i think it must have been anyway what really got me was that it was a boy speaking so i unlocked the door to tell him to go and use his own toilet and then myrtle swelled importantly her face shining i died how said harry no idea said myrtle in hushed tones i just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes my whole body sort of seized up and then i was floating away she looked dreamily at harry and then i came back again i was determined to haunt olive hornby you see oh she was sorry shed ever laughed at my glasses where exactly did you see the eyes said harry somewhere there said myrtle pointing vaguely toward the sink in front of her toilet harry and ron hurried over to it lockhart was standing well back a look of utter terror on his face it looked like an ordinary sink they examined every inch of it inside and out including the pipes below and then harry saw it scratched on the side of one of the copper taps was a tiny snake that taps never worked said myrtle brightly as he tried to turn it harry said ron say something something in parseltongue but harry thought hard the only times hed ever managed to speak parseltongue were when hed been faced with a real snake he stared hard at the tiny engraving trying to imagine it was real open up he said he looked at ron who shook his head english he said harry looked back at the snake willing himself to believe it was alive if he moved his head the candlelight made it look as though it were moving open up he said except that the words werent what he heard a strange hissing had escaped him and at once the tap glowed with a brilliant white light and began to spin next second the sink began to move the sink in fact sank right out of sight leaving a large pipe exposed a pipe wide enough for a man to slide into harry heard ron gasp and looked up again he had made up his mind what he was going to do im going down there he said he couldnt not go not now they had found the entrance to the chamber not if there was even the faintest slimmest wildest chance that ginny might be alive me too said ron there was a pause well you hardly seem to need me said lockhart with a shadow of his old smile ill just he put his hand on the door knob but ron and harry both pointed their wands at him you can go first ron snarled whitefaced and wandless lockhart approached the opening boys he said his voice feeble boys what good will it do harry jabbed him in the back with his wand lockhart slid his legs into the pipe i really dont think he started to say but ron gave him a push and he slid out of sight harry followed quickly he lowered himself slowly into the pipe then let go it was like rushing down an endless slimy dark slide he could see more pipes branching off in all directions but none as large as theirs which twisted and turned sloping steeply downward and he knew that he was falling deeper below the school than even the dungeons behind him he could hear ron thudding slightly at the curves and then just as he had begun to worry about what would happen when he hit the ground the pipe leveled out and he shot out of the end with a wet thud landing on the damp floor of a dark stone tunnel large enough to stand in lockhart was getting to his feet a little ways away covered in slime and white as a ghost harry stood aside as ron came whizzing out of the pipe too we must be miles under the school said harry his voice echoing in the black tunnel under the lake probably said ron squinting around at the dark slimy walls all three of them turned to stare into the darkness ahead lumos harry muttered to his wand and it lit again cmon he said to ron and lockhart and off they went their footsteps slapping loudly on the wet floor the tunnel was so dark that they could only see a little distance ahead their shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the wandlight remember harry said quietly as they walked cautiously forward any sign of movement close your eyes right away but the tunnel was quiet as the grave and the first unexpected sound they heard was a loud crunch as ron stepped on what turned out to be a rats skull harry lowered his wand to look at the floor and saw that it was littered with small animal bones trying very hard not to imagine what ginny might look like if they found her harry led the way forward around a dark bend in the tunnel harry theres something up there said ron hoarsely grabbing harrys shoulder they froze watching harry could just see the outline of something huge and curved lying right across the tunnel it wasnt moving maybe its asleep he breathed glancing back at the other two lockharts hands were pressed over his eyes harry turned back to look at the thing his heart beating so fast it hurt very slowly his eyes as narrow as he could make them and still see harry edged forward his wand held high the light slid over a gigantic snake skin of a vivid poisonous green lying curled and empty across the tunnel floor the creature that had shed it must have been twenty feet long at least blimey said ron weakly there was a sudden movement behind them gilderoy lockharts knees had given way get up said ron sharply pointing his wand at lockhart lockhart got to his feet then he dived at ron knocking him to the ground harry jumped forward but too late lockhart was straightening up panting rons wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back on his face the adventure ends here boys he said i shall take a bit of this skin back up to the school tell them i was too late to save the girl and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body say goodbye to your memories he raised rons spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled obliviate the wand exploded with the force of a small bomb harry flung his arms over his head and ran slipping over the coils of snake skin out of the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering to the floor next moment he was standing alone gazing at a solid wall of broken rock ron he shouted are you okay ron im here came rons muffled voice from behind the rockfall im okay this gits not though he got blasted by the wand there was a dull thud and a loud ow it sounded as though ron had just kicked lockhart in the shins what now rons voice said sounding desperate we cant get through itll take ages harry looked up at the tunnel ceiling huge cracks had appeared in it he had never tried to break apart anything as large as these rocks by magic and now didnt seem a good moment to try what if the whole tunnel caved in there was another thud and another ow from behind the rocks they were wasting time ginny had already been in the chamber of secrets for hours harry knew there was only one thing to do wait there he called to ron wait with lockhart ill go on if im not back in an hour there was a very pregnant pause ill try and shift some of this rock said ron who seemed to be trying to keep his voice steady so you can can get back through and harry see you in a bit said harry trying to inject some confidence into his shaking voice and he set off alone past the giant snake skin soon the distant noise of ron straining to shift the rocks was gone the tunnel turned and turned again every nerve in harrys body was tingling unpleasantly he wanted the tunnel to end yet dreaded what hed find when it did and then at last as he crept around yet another bend he saw a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents were carved their eyes set with great glinting emeralds harry approached his throat very dry there was no need to pretend these stone snakes were real their eyes looked strangely alive he could guess what he had to do he cleared his throat and the emerald eyes seemed to flicker open said harry in a low faint hiss the serpents parted as the wall cracked open the halves slid smoothly out of sight and harry shaking from head to foot walked inside chapter seventeen the heir to slytherin he was standing at the end of a very long dimly lit chamber towering stone pillars entwined with more carved serpents rose to support a ceiling lost in darkness casting long black shadows through the odd greenish gloom that filled the place his heart beating very fast harry stood listening to the chill silence could the basilisk be lurking in a shadowy corner behind a pillar and where was ginny he pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentine columns every careful footstep echoed loudly off the shadowy walls he kept his eyes narrowed ready to clamp them shut at the smallest sign of movement the hollow eye sockets of the stone snakes seemed to be following him more than once with a jolt of the stomach he thought he saw one stir then as he drew level with the last pair of pillars a statue high as the chamber itself loomed into view standing against the back wall harry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant face above it was ancient and monkeyish with a long thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the wizards sweeping stone robes where two enormous gray feet stood on the smooth chamber floor and between the feet facedown lay a small blackrobed figure with flamingred hair ginny harry muttered sprinting to her and dropping to his knees ginny dont be dead please dont be dead he flung his wand aside grabbed ginnys shoulders and turned her over her face was white as marble and as cold yet her eyes were closed so she wasnt petrified but then she must be ginny please wake up harry muttered desperately shaking her ginnys head lolled hopelessly from side to side she wont wake said a soft voice harry jumped and spun around on his knees a tall blackhaired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar watching he was strangely blurred around the edges as though harry were looking at him through a misted window but there was no mistaking him tom tom riddle riddle nodded not taking his eyes off harrys face what dyou mean she wont wake harry said desperately shes not shes not shes still alive said riddle but only just harry stared at him tom riddle had been at hogwarts fifty years ago yet here he stood a weird misty light shining about him not a day older than sixteen are you a ghost harry said uncertainly a memory said riddle quietly preserved in a diary for fifty years he pointed toward the floor near the statues giant toes lying open there was the little black diary harry had found in moaning myrtles bathroom for a second harry wondered how it had got there but there were more pressing matters to deal with youve got to help me tom harry said raising ginnys head again weve got to get her out of here theres a basilisk i dont know where it is but it could be along any moment please help me riddle didnt move harry sweating managed to hoist ginny half off the floor and bent to pick up his wand again but his wand had gone did you see he looked up riddle was still watching him twirling harrys wand between his long fingers thanks said harry stretching out his hand for it a smile curled the corners of riddles mouth he continued to stare at harry twirling the wand idly listen said harry urgently his knees sagging with ginnys dead weight weve got to go if the basilisk comes it wont come until it is called said riddle calmly harry lowered ginny back onto the floor unable to hold her up any longer what dyou mean he said look give me my wand i might need it riddles smile broadened you wont be needing it he said harry stared at him what dyou mean i wont be ive waited a long time for this harry potter said riddle for the chance to see you to speak to you look said harry losing patience i dont think you get it were in the chamber of secrets we can talk later were going to talk now said riddle still smiling broadly and he pocketed harrys wand harry stared at him there was something very funny going on here how did ginny get like this he asked slowly well thats an interesting question said riddle pleasantly and quite a long story i suppose the real reason ginny weasleys like this is because she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an invisible stranger what are you talking about said harry the diary said riddle my diary little ginnys been writing in it for months and months telling me all her pitiful worries and woes how her brothers tease her how she had to come to school with secondhand robes and books how riddles eyes glinted how she didnt think famous good great harry potter would ever like her all the time he spoke riddles eyes never left harrys face there was an almost hungry look in them its very boring having to listen to the silly little troubles of an eleven yearold girl he went on but i was patient i wrote back i was sympathetic i was kind ginny simply loved me no ones ever understood me like you tom im so glad ive got this diary to confide in its like having a friend i can carry around in my pocket riddle laughed a high cold laugh that didnt suit him it made the hairs stand up on the back of harrys neck if i say it myself harry ive always been able to charm the people i needed so ginny poured out her soul to me and her soul happened to be exactly what i wanted i grew stronger and stronger on a diet of her deepest fears her darkest secrets i grew powerful far more powerful than little miss weasley powerful enough to start feeding miss weasley a few of my secrets to start pouring a little of my soul back into her what dyou mean said harry whose mouth had gone very dry havent you guessed yet harry potter said riddle softly ginny weasley opened the chamber of secrets she strangled the school roosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls she set the serpent of slytherin on four mudbloods and the squibs cat no harry whispered yes said riddle calmly of course she didnt know what she was doing at first it was very amusing i wish you could have seen her new diary entries far more interesting they became dear tom he recited watching harrys horrified face i think im losing my memory there are rooster feathers all over my robes and 1 dont know how they got there dear tom l cant remember what i did on the night of halloween but a cat was attacked and ive got paint all down my front dear tom percy keeps telling me im pale and im not myself i think he suspects me there was another attack today and i dont know where i was tom what am i going to do i think im going mad i think im the one attacking everyone tom harrys fists were clenched the nails digging deep into his palms it took a very long time for stupid little ginny to stop trusting her diary said riddle but she finally became suspicious and tried to dispose of it and thats where you came in harry you found it and i couldnt have been more delighted of all the people who could have picked it up it was you the very person i was most anxious to meet and why did you want to meet me said harry anger was coursing through him and it was an effort to keep his voice steady well you see ginny told me all about you harry said riddle your whole fascinating history his eyes roved over the lightning scar on harrys forehead and their expression grew hungrier i knew i must find out more about you talk to you meet you if i could so i decided to show you my famous capture of that great oaf hagrid to gain your trust hagrids my friend said harry his voice now shaking and you framed him didnt you i thought you made a mistake but riddle laughed his high laugh again it was my word against hagrids harry well you can imagine how it looked to old armando dippet on the one hand tom riddle poor but brilliant parentless but so brave school prefect model student on the other hand big blundering hagrid in trouble every other week trying to raise werewolf cubs under his bed sneaking off to the forbidden forest to wrestle trolls but i admit even i was surprised how well the plan worked i thought someone must realize that hagrid couldnt possibly be the heir of slytherin it had taken me five whole years to find out everything i could about the chamber of secrets and discover the secret entrance as though hagrid had the brains or the power only the transfiguration teacher dumbledore seemed to think hagrid was innocent he persuaded dipper to keep hagrid and train him as gamekeeper yes i think dumbledore might have guessed dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did i bet dumbledore saw right through you said harry his teeth gritted well he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after hagrid was expelled said riddle carelessly i knew it wouldnt be safe to open the chamber again while i was still at school but i wasnt going to waste those long years id spent searching for it i decided to leave behind a diary preserving my sixteen yearold self in its pages so that one day with luck i would be able to lead another in my footsteps and finish salazar slytherins noble work well you havent finished it said harry triumphantly no ones died this time not even the cat in a few hours the mandrake draught will be ready and everyone who was petrified will be all right again havent i already told you said riddle quietly that killing mudbloods doesnt matter to me anymore for many months now my new target has been you harry stared at him imagine how angry i was when the next time my diary was opened it was ginny who was writing to me not you she saw you with the diary you see and panicked what if you found out how to work it and i repeated all her secrets to you what if even worse i told you whod been strangling roosters so the foolish little brat waited until your dormitory was deserted and stole it back but i knew what i must do it was clear to me that you were on the trail of slytherins heir from everything ginny had told me about you i knew you would go to any lengths to solve the mystery particularly if one of your best friends was attacked and ginny had told me the whole school was buzzing because you could speak parseltongue so i made ginny write her own farewell on the wall and come down here to wait she struggled and cried and became very boring but there isnt much life left in her she put too much into the diary into me enough to let me leave its pages at last i have been waiting for you to appear since we arrived here i knew youd come i have many questions for you harry potter like what harry spat fists still clenched well said riddle smiling pleasantly how is it that you a skinny boy with no extraordinary magical talent managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all time how did you escape with nothing but a scar while lord voldemorts powers were destroyed there was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now why do you care how i escaped said harry slowly voldemort was after your time voldemort said riddle softly is my past present and future harry potter he pulled harrys wand from his pocket and began to trace it through the air writing three shimmering words tom marvolo riddle then he waved the wand once and the letters of his name rearranged themselves i am lord voldemort you see he whispered it was a name i was already using at hogwarts to my most intimate friends only of course you think i was going to use my filthy muggle fathers name forever i in whose veins runs the blood of salazar slytherin himself through my mothers side i keep the name of a foul common muggle who abandoned me even before i was born just because he found out his wife was a witch no harry i fashioned myself a new name a name i knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak when i had become the greatest sorcerer in the world harrys brain seemed to have jammed he stared numbly at riddle at the orphaned boy who had grown up to murder harrys own parents and so many others at last he forced himself to speak youre not he said his quiet voice full of hatred not what snapped riddle not the greatest sorcerer in the world said harry breathing fast sorry to disappoint you and all that but the greatest wizard in the world is albus dumbledore everyone says so even when you were strong you didnt dare try and take over at hogwarts dumbledore saw through you when you were at school and he still frightens you now wherever youre hiding these days the smile had gone from riddles face to be replaced by a very ugly look dumbledores been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me he hissed hes not as gone as you might think harry retorted he was speaking at random wanting to scare riddle wishing rather than believing it to be true riddle opened his mouth but froze music was coming from somewhere riddle whirled around to stare down the empty chamber the music was growing louder it was eerie spinetingling unearthly it lifted the hair on harrys scalp and made his heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its normal size then as the music reached such a pitch that harry felt it vibrating inside his own ribs flames erupted at the top of the nearest pillar a crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared piping its weird music to the vaulted ceiling it had a glittering golden tail as long as a peacocks and gleaming golden talons which were gripping a ragged bundle a second later the bird was flying straight at harry it dropped the ragged thing it was carrying at his feet then landed heavily on his shoulder as it folded its great wings harry looked up and saw it had a long sharp golden beak and a beady black eye the bird stopped singing it sat still and warm next to harrys cheek gazing steadily at riddle thats a phoenix said riddle staring shrewdly back at it fawkes harry breathed and he felt the birds golden claws squeeze his shoulder gently and that said riddle now eyeing the ragged thing that fawkes had dropped thats the old school sorting hat so it was patched frayed and dirty the hat lay motionless at harrys feet riddle began to laugh again he laughed so hard that the dark chamber rang with it as though ten riddles were laughing at once this is what dumbledore sends his defender a songbird and an old hat do you feel brave harry potter do you feel safe now harry didnt answer he might not see what use fawkes or the sorting hat were but he was no longer alone and he waited for riddle to stop laughing with his courage mounting to business harry said riddle still smiling broadly twice in your past in my future we have met and twice i failed to kill you how did you survive tell me everything the longer you talk he added softly the longer you stay alive harry was thinking fast weighing his chances riddle had the wand he harry had fawkes and the sorting hat neither of which would be much good in a duel it looked bad all right but the longer riddle stood there the more life was dwindling out of ginny and in the meantime harry noticed suddenly riddles outline was becoming clearer more solid if it had to be a fight between him and riddle better sooner than later no one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked me said harry abruptly i dont know myself but i know why you couldnt kill me because my mother died to save me my common muggleborn mother he added shaking with suppressed rage she stopped you killing me and ive seen the real you i saw you last year youre a wreck youre barely alive thats where all your power got you youre in hiding youre ugly youre foul riddles face contorted then he forced it into an awful smile so your mother died to save you yes thats a powerful countercharm i can see now there is nothing special about you after all i wondered you see there are strange likenesses between us after all even you must have noticed both halfbloods orphans raised by muggles probably the only two parselmouths to come to hogwarts since the great slytherin himself we even look something alike but after all it was merely a lucky chance that saved you from me thats all i wanted to know harry stood tense waiting for riddle to raise his wand but riddles twisted smile was widening again now harry im going to teach you a little lesson lets match the powers of lord voldemort heir of salazar slytherin against famous harry potter and the best weapons dumbledore can give him he cast an amused eye over fawkes and the sorting hat then walked away harry fear spreading up his numb legs watched ridthe stop between the high pillars and look up into the stone face of slytherin high above him in the halfdarkness riddle opened his mouth wide and hissed but harry understood what he was saying speak to me slytherin greatest of the hogwarts four harry wheeled around to look up at the statue fawkes swaying on his shoulder slytherins gigantic stone face was moving horrorstruck harry saw his mouth opening wider and wider to make a huge black hole and something was stirring inside the statues mouth something was slithering up from its depths harry backed away until he hit the dark chamber wall and as he shut his eyes tight he felt fawkes wing sweep his cheek as he took flight harry wanted to shout dont leave me but what chance did a phoenix have against the king of serpents something huge hit the stone floor of the chamber harry felt it shudder he knew what was happening he could sense it could almost see the giant serpent uncoiling itself from slytherins mouth then he heard riddles hissing voice kill him the basilisk was moving toward harry he could hear its heavy body slithering heavily across the dusty floor eyes still tightly shut harry began to run blindly sideways his hands outstretched feeling his way voldemort was laughing harry tripped he fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood the serpent was barely feet from him he could hear it coming there was a loud explosive spitting sound right above him and then something heavy hit harry so hard that he was smashed into the wall waiting for fangs to sink through his body he heard more mad hissing something thrashing wildly off the pillars he couldnt help it he opened his eyes wide enough to squint at what was going on the enormous serpent bright poisonous green thick as an oak trunk had raised itself high in the air and its great blunt head was weaving drunkenly between the pillars as harry trembled ready to close his eyes if it turned he saw what had distracted the snake fawkes was soaring around its head and the basilisk was snapping furiously at him with fangs long and thin as sabers fawkes dived his long golden beak sank out of sight and a sudden shower of dark blood spattered the floor the snakes tail thrashed narrowly missing harry and before harry could shut his eyes it turned harry looked straight into its face and saw that its eyes both its great bulbous yellow eyes had been punctured by the phoenix blood was streaming to the floor and the snake was spitting in agony no harry heard riddle screaming leave the bird leave the bird the boy is behind you you can still smell him kill himi the blinded serpent swayed confused still deadly fawkes was circling its head piping his eerie song jabbing here and there at its scaly nose as the blood poured from its ruined eyes help me help me harry muttered wildly someone anyone the snakes tail whipped across the floor again harry ducked something soft hit his face the basilisk had swept the sorting hat into harrys arms harry seized it it was all he had left his only chance he rammed it onto his head and threw himself flat onto the floor as the basilisks tail swung over him again help me help me harry thought his eyes screwed tight under the hat please help me there was no answering voice instead the hat contracted as though an invisible hand was squeezing it very tightly something very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of harrys head almost knocking him out stars winking in front of his eyes he grabbed the top of the hat to pull it off and felt something long and hard beneath it a gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat its handle glittering with rubies the size of eggs kill the boy leave the bird the boy is behind you sniff smell him harry was on his feet ready the basilisks head was falling its body coiling around hitting pillars as it twisted to face him he could see the vast bloody eye sockets see the mouth stretching wide wide enough to swallow him whole lined with fangs long as his sword thin glittering venomous it lunged blindly harry dodged and it hit the chamber wall it lunged again and its forked tongue lashed harrys side he raised the sword in both his hands the basilisk lunged again and this time its aim was true harry threw his whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof of the serpents mouth but as warm blood drenched harrys arms he felt a searing pain just above his elbow one long poisonous fang was sinking deeper and deeper into his arm and it splintered as the basilisk keeled over sideways and fell twitching to the floor harry slid down the wall he gripped the fang that was spreading poison through his body and wrenched it out of his arm but he knew it was too late whitehot pain was spreading slowly and steadily from the wound even as he dropped the fang and watched his own blood soaking his robes his vision went foggy the chamber was dissolving in a whirl of dull color patch of scarlet swam past and harry heard a soft clatter of claws beside him fawkes said harry thickly you were fantastic fawkes he felt the bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the serpents fang had pierced him he could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved in front of him youre dead harry potter said riddles voice above him dead even dumbledores bird knows it do you see what hes doing potter hes crying harry blinked fawkes head slid in and out of focus thick pearly tears were trickling down the glossy feathers im going to sit here and watch you die harry potter take your time im in no hurry harry felt drowsy everything around him seemed to be spinning so ends the famous harry potter said riddles distant voice alone in the chamber of secrets forsaken by his friends defeated at last by the dark lord he so unwisely challenged youll be back with your dear mudblood mother soon harry she bought you twelve years of borrowed time but lord voldemort got you in the end as you knew he must if this is dying thought harry its not so bad even the pain was leaving him but was this dying instead of going black the chamber seemed to be coming back into focus harry gave his head a little shake and there was fawkes still resting his head on harrys arm a pearly patch of tears was shining all around the wound except that there was no wound get away bird said riddles voice suddenly get away from him i said get away harry raised his head riddle was pointing harrys wand at fawkes there was a bang like a gun and fawkes took flight again in a whirl of gold and scarlet phoenix tears said riddle quietly staring at harrys arm of course healing powers i forgot he looked into harrys face but it makes no difference in fact i prefer it this way just you and me harry potter you and me he raised the wand then in a rush of wings fawkes had soared back overhead and something fell into harrys lap the diary for a split second both harry and riddle wand still raised stared at it then without thinking without considering as though he had meant to do it all along harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to him and plunged it straight into the heart of the book there was a long dreadful piercing scream ink spurted out of the diary in torrents streaming over harrys hands flooding the floor riddle was writhing and twisting screaming and flailing and then he had gone harrys wand fell to the floor with a clatter and there was silence silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozing from the diary the basilisk venom had burned a sizzling hole right through it shaking all over harry pulled himself up his head was spinning as though hed just traveled miles by floo powder slowly he gathered together his wand and the sorting hat and with a huge tug retrieved the glittering sword from the roof of the basilisks mouth then came a faint moan from the end of the chamber ginny was stirring as harry hurried toward her she sat up her bemused eyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk over harry in his bloodsoaked robes then to the diary in his hand she drew a great shuddering gasp and tears began to pour down her face harry oh harry i tried to tell you at bbreakfast but i ccouldnt say it in front of percy it was me harry but i i sswear i ddidnt mean to r riddle made me he ttook me over and how did you kill that that thing w wheres riddle the last thing i rremember is him coming out of the diary its all right said harry holding up the diary and showing ginny the fang hole riddles finished look him and the basilisk cmon ginny lets get out of here im going to be expelled ginny wept as harry helped her awkwardly to her feet ive looked forward to coming to hogwarts ever since bbill came and nnow ill have to leave and wwhatll mum and dad say fawkes was waiting for them hovering in the chamber entrance harry urged ginny forward they stepped over the motionless coils of the dead basilisk through the echoing gloom and back into the tunnel harry heard the stone doors close behind them with a soft hiss after a few minutes progress up the dark tunnel a distant sound of slowly shifting rock reached harrys ears ron harry yelled speeding up ginnys okay ive got her he heard ron give a strangled cheer and they turned the next bend to see his eager face staring through the sizable gap he had managed to make in the rock fall ginny ron thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pull her through first youre alive i dont believe it what happened how what where did that bird come from fawkes had swooped through the gap after ginny hes dumbledores said harry squeezing through himself how come youve got a sword said ron gaping at the glittering weapon in harrys hand ill explain when we get out of here said harry with a sideways glance at ginny who was crying harder than ever but later harry said shortly he didnt think it was a good idea to tell ron yet whod been opening the chamber not in front of ginny anyway wheres lockhart back there said ron still looking puzzled but jerking his head up the tunnel toward the pipe hes in a bad way come and see led by fawkes whose wide scarlet wings emitted a soft golden glow in the darkness they walked all the way back to the mouth of the pipe gilderoy lockhart was sitting there humming placidly to himself his memorys gone said ron the memory charm backfired hit him instead of us hasnt got a clue who he is or where he is or who we are i told him to come and wait here hes a danger to himself lockhart peered goodnaturedly up at them all hello he said odd sort of place this isnt it do you live here no said ron raising his eyebrows at harry harry bent down and looked up the long dark pipe have you thought how were going to get back up this he said to ron ron shook his head but fawkes the phoenix had swooped past harry and was now fluttering in front of him his beady eyes bright in the dark he was waving his long golden tail feathers harry looked uncertainly at him he looks like he wants you to grab hold said ron looking perplexed but youre much too heavy for a bird to pull up there fawkes said harry isnt an ordinary bird he turned quickly to the others weve got to hold on to each other ginny grab rons hand professor lockhart he means you said ron sharply to lockhart you hold ginnys other hand harry tucked the sword and the sorting hat into his belt ron took hold of the back of harrys robes and harry reached out and took hold of fawkess strangely hot tail feathers an extraordinary lightness seemed to spread through his whole body and the next second in a rush of wings they were flying upward through the pipe harry could hear lockhart dangling below him saying amazing amazing this is just like magic the chill air was whipping through harrys hair and before hed stopped enjoying the ride it was over all four of them were hitting the wet floor of moaning myrtles bathroom and as lockhart straightened his hat the sink that hid the pipe was sliding back into place myrtle goggled at them youre alive she said blankly to harry theres no need to sound so disappointed he said grimly wiping flecks of blood and slime off his glasses oh well id just been thinking if you had died youd have been welcome to share my toilet said myrtle blushing silver urgh said ron as they left the bathroom for the dark deserted corridor outside harry i think myrtles grown fond of you youve got competition ginny but tears were still flooding silently down ginnys face where now said ron with an anxious look at ginny harry pointed fawkes was leading the way glowing gold along the corridor they strode after him and moments later found themselves outside professor mcgonagalls office harry knocked and pushed the door open chapter eighteen dobbys reward for a moment there was silence as harry ron ginny and lockhart stood in the doorway covered in muck and slime and in harrys case blood then there was a scream ginny it was mrs weasley who had been sitting crying in front of the fire she leapt to her feet closely followed by mr weasley and both of them flung themselves on their daughter harry however was looking past them professor dumbledore was standing by the mantelpiece beaming next to professor mcgonagall who was taking great steadying gasps clutching her chest fawkes went whooshing past harrys ear and settled on dumbledores shoulder just as harry found himself and ron being swept into mrs weasleys tight embrace you saved her you saved her how did you do it i think wed all like to know that said professor mcgonagall weakly mrs weasley let go of harry who hesitated for a moment then walked over to the desk and laid upon it the sorting hat the ruby encrusted sword and what remained of riddles diary then he started telling them everything for nearly a quarter of an hour he spoke into the rapt silence he told them about hearing the disembodied voice how hermione had finally realized that he was hearing a basilisk in the pipes how he and ron had followed the spiders into the forest that aragog had told them where the last victim of the basilisk had died how he had guessed that moaning myrtle had been the victim and that the entrance to the chamber of secrets might be in her bathroom very well professor mcgonagall prompted him as he paused so you found out where the entrance was breaking a hundred school rules into pieces along the way i might add but how on earth did you all get out of there alive potter so harry his voice now growing hoarse from all this talking told them about fawkess timely arrival and about the sorting hat giving him the sword but then he faltered he had so far avoided mentioning riddles diary or ginny she was standing with her head against mrs weasleys shoulder and tears were still coursing silently down her cheeks what if they expelled her harry thought in panic riddles diary didnt work anymore how could they prove it had been he whod made her do it all instinctively harry looked at dumbledore who smiled faintly the firelight glancing off his halfmoon spectacles what interests me most said dumbledore gently is how lord voldemort managed to enchant ginny when my sources tell me he is currently in hiding in the forests of albania relief warm sweeping glorious relief swept over harry wwhats that said mr weasley in a stunned voice youknowwho enenchant ginny but ginnys not ginny hasnt been has she it was this diary said harry quickly picking it up and showing it to dumbledore riddle wrote it when he was sixteen dumbledore took the diary from harry and peered keenly down his long crooked nose at its burnt and soggy pages brilliant he said softly of course he was probably the most brilliant student hogwarts has ever seen he turned around to the weasleys who were looking utterly bewildered very few people know that lord voldemort was once called tom riddle i taught him myself fifty years ago at hogwarts he disappeared after leaving the school traveled far and wide sank so deeply into the dark arts consorted with the very worst of our kind underwent so many dangerous magical transformations that when he resurfaced as lord voldemort he was barely recognizable hardly anyone connected lord voldemort with the clever handsome boy who was once head boy here but ginny said mrs weasley whats our ginny got to do with with him his ddiary ginny sobbed ive bbeen writing in it and hes been w writing back all year ginny said mr weasley flabbergasted havent i taught you anything what have i always told you never trust anything that can think for itself if you cant see where it keeps its brain why didnt you show the diary to me or your mother a suspicious object like that it was clearly full of dark magic i ddidnt know sobbed ginny i found it inside one of the books mum got me i ththought someone had just left it in there and forgotten about it miss weasley should go up to the hospital wing right away dumbledore interrupted in a firm voice this has been a terrible ordeal for her there will be no punishment older and wiser wizards than she have been hoodwinked by lord voldemort he strode over to the door and opened it bed rest and perhaps a large steaming mug of hot chocolate i always find that cheers me up he added twinkling kindly down at her you will find that madam pomfrey is still awake shes just giving out mandrake juice i daresay the basilisks victims will be waking up any moment so hermiones okay said ron brightly there has been no lasting harm done ginny said dumbledore mrs weasley led ginny out and mr weasley followed still looking deeply shaken you know minerva professor dumbledore said thoughtfully to professor mcgonagall i think all this merits a good feast might i ask you to go and alert the kitchens right said professor mcgonagall crisply also moving to the door ill leave you to deal with potter and weasley shall i certainly said dumbledore she left and harry and ron gazed uncertainly at dumbledore what exactly had professor mcgonagall meant deal with them surely surely they werent about to be punished i seem to remember telling you both that i would have to expel you if you broke any more school rules said dumbledore ron opened his mouth in horror which goes to show that the best of us must sometimes eat our words dumbledore went on smiling you will both receive special awards for services to the school and let me see yes i think two hundred points apiece for gryffindor ron went as bright pink as lockharts valentine flowers and closed his mouth again but one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet about his part in this dangerous adventure dumbledore added why so modest gilderoy harry gave a start he had completely forgotten about lockhart he turned and saw that lockhart was standing in a corner of the room still wearing his vague smile when dumbledore addressed him lockhart looked over his shoulder to see who he was talking to professor dumbledore ron said quickly there was an accident down in the chamber of secrets professor lockhart am i a professor said lockhart in mild surprise goodness i expect i was hopeless was i he tried to do a memory charm and the wand backfired ron explained quietly to dumbledore dear me said dumbledore shaking his head his long silver mustache quivering impaled upon your own sword gilderoy sword said lockhart dimly havent got a sword that boy has though he pointed at harry hell lend you one would you mind taking professor lockhart up to the infirmary too dumbledore said to ron id like a few more words with harry lockhart ambled out ron cast a curious look back at dumbledore and harry as he closed the door dumbledore crossed to one of the chairs by the fire sit down harry he said and harry sat feeling unaccountably nervous first of all harry i want to thank you said dumbledore eyes twinkling again you must have shown me real loyalty down in the chamber nothing but that could have called fawkes to you he stroked the phoenix which had fluttered down onto his knee harry grinned awkwardly as dumbledore watched him and so you met tom riddle said dumbledore thoughtfully i imagine he was most interested in you suddenly something that was nagging at harry came tumbling out of his mouth professor dumbledore riddle said im like him strange likenesses he said did he now said dumbledore looking thoughtfully at harry from under his thick silver eyebrows and what do you think harry i dont think im like him said harry more loudly than hed intended i mean im im in gryffindor im but he fell silent a lurking doubt resurfacing in his mind professor he started again after a moment the sorting hat told me id id have done well in slytherin everyone thought i was slytherins heir for a while because i can speak parseltongue you can speak parseltongue harry said dumbledore calmly because lord voldemort who is the last remaining ancestor of salazar slytherin can speak parseltongue unless im much mistaken he transferred some of his own powers to you the night he gave you that scar not something he intended to do im sure voldemort put a bit of himself in me harry said thunderstruck it certainly seems so so i should be in slytherin harry said looking desperately into dumbledores face the sorting hat could see slytherins power in me and it put you in gryffindor said dumbledore calmly listen to me harry you happen to have many qualities salazar slytherin prized in his handpicked students his own very rare gift parseltongue resourcefulness determination a certain disregard for rules he added his mustache quivering again yet the sorting hat placed you in gryffindor you know why that was think it only put me in gryffindor said harry in a defeated voice because i asked not to go in slytherin exactly said dumbledore beaming once more which makes you very different from tom riddle it is our choices harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities harry sat motionless in his chair stunned if you want proof harry that you belong in gryffindor i suggest you look more closely at this dumbledore reached across to professor mcgonagalls desk picked up the bloodstained silver sword and handed it to harry dully harry turned it over the rubies blazing in the firelight and then he saw the name engraved just below the hilt godric gryffindor only a true gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat harry said dumbledore simply for a minute neither of them spoke then dumbledore pulled open one of the drawers in professor mcgonagalls desk and took out a quill and a bottle of ink what you need harry is some food and sleep i suggest you go down to the feast while i write to azkaban we need our gamekeeper back and i must draft an advertisement for the daily prophet too he added thoughtfully well be needing a new defense against the dark arts teacher dear me we do seem to run through them dont we harry got up and crossed to the door he had just reached for the handle however when the door burst open so violently that it bounced back off the wall lucius malfoy stood there fury in his face and cowering behind his legs heavily wrapped in bandages was dobby good evening lucius said dumbledore pleasantly mr malfoy almost knocked harry over as he swept into the room dobby went scurrying in after him crouching at the hem of his cloak a look of abject terror on his face the elf was carrying a stained rag with which he was attempting to finish cleaning mr malfoys shoes apparently mr malfoy had set out in a great hurry for not only were his shoes halfpolished but his usually sleek hair was disheveled ignoring the elf bobbing apologetically around his ankles he fixed his cold eyes upon dumbledore so he said youve come back the governors suspended you but you still saw fit to return to hogwarts well you see lucius said dumbledore smiling serenely the other eleven governors contacted me today it was something like being caught in a hailstorm of owls to tell the truth theyd heard that arthur weasleys daughter had been killed and wanted me back here at once they seemed to think i was the best man for the job after all very strange tales they told me too several of them seemed to think that you had threatened to curse their families if they didnt agree to suspend me in the first place mr malfoy went even paler than usual but his eyes were still slits of fury so have you stopped the attacks yet he sneered have you caught the culprit we have said dumbledore with a smile well said mr malfoy sharply who is it the same person as last time lucius said dumbledore but this time lord voldemort was acting through somebody else by means of this diary he held up the small black book with the large hole through the center watching mr malfoy closely harry however was watching dobby the elf was doing something very odd his great eyes fixed meaningfully on harry he kept pointing at the diary then at mr malfoy and then hitting himself hard on the head with his fist i see said mr malfoy slowly to dumbledore a clever plan said dumbledore in a level voice still staring mr malfoy straight in the eye because if harry here mr malfoy shot harry a swift sharp look and his friend ron hadnt discovered this book why ginny weasley might have taken all the blame no one would ever have been able to prove she hadnt acted of her own free will mr malfoy said nothing his face was suddenly masklike and imagine dumbledore went on what might have happened then the weasleys are one of our most prominent pureblood families imagine the effect on arthur weasley and his muggle protection act if his own daughter was discovered attacking and killing mugglebornvery fortunate the diary was discovered and riddles memories wiped from it who knows what the consequences might have been otherwise mr malfoy forced himself to speak very fortunate he said stiffly and still behind his back dobby was pointing first to the diary then to lucius malfoy then punching himself in the head and harry suddenly understood he nodded at dobby and dobby backed into a corner now twisting his ears in punishment dont you want to know how ginny got hold of that diary mr malfoy said harry lucius malfoy rounded on him how should i know how the stupid little girl got hold of it he said because you gave it to her said harry in flourish and blotts you picked up her old transfiguration book and slipped the diary inside it didnt you he saw mr malfoys white hands clench and unclench prove it he hissed oh no one will be able to do that said dumbledore smiling at harry not now that riddle has vanished from the book on the other hand i would advise you lucius not to go giving out any more of lord voldemorts old school things if any more of them find their way into innocent hands i think arthur weasley for one will make sure they are traced back to you lucius malfoy stood for a moment and harry distinctly saw his right hand twitch as though he was longing to reach for his wand instead he turned to his houseelf were going dobby he wrenched open the door and as the elf came hurrying up to him he kicked him right through it they could hear dobby squealing with pain all the way along the corridor harry stood for a moment thinking hard then it came to him professor dumbledore he said hurriedly can i give that diary back to mr malfoy please certainly harry said dumbledore calmly but hurry the feast remember harry grabbed the diary and dashed out of the office he could hear dobbys squeals of pain receding around the corner quickly wondering if this plan could possibly work harry took off one of his shoes pulled off his slimy filthy sock and stuffed the diary into it then he ran down the dark corridor he caught up with them at the top of the stairs mr malfoy he gasped skidding to a halt ive got something for you and he forced the smelly sock into lucius malfoys hand what the mr malfoy ripped the sock off the diary threw it aside then looked furiously from the ruined book to harry youll meet the same sticky end as your parents one of these days harry potter he said softly they were meddlesome fools too he turned to go come dobby i said come but dobby didnt move he was holding up harrys disgusting slimy sock and looking at it as though it were a priceless treasure master has given a sock said the elf in wonderment master gave it to dobby whats that spat mr malfoy what did you say got a sock said dobby in disbelief master threw it and dobby caught it and dobby dobby is free lucius malfoy stood frozen staring at the elf then he lunged at harry youve lost me my servant boy but dobby shouted you shall not harm harry potter there was a loud bang and mr malfoy was thrown backward he crashed down the stairs three at a time landing in a crumpled heap on the landing below he got up his face livid and pulled out his wand but dobby raised a long threatening finger you shall go now he said fiercely pointing down at mr malfoy you shall not touch harry potter you shall go now lucius malfoy had no choice with a last incensed stare at the pair of them he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight harry potter freed dobby said the elf shrilly gazing up at harry moonlight from the nearest window reflected in his orblike eyes harry potter set dobby free least i could do dobby said harry grinning just promise never to try and save my life again the elfs ugly brown face split suddenly into a wide toothy smile ive just got one question dobby said harry as dobby pulled on harrys sock with shaking hands you told me all this had nothing to do with hewho mustnotbenamed remember well it was a clue sir said dobby his eyes widening as though this was obvious was giving you a clue the dark lord before he changed his name could be freely named you see right said harry weakly well id better go theres a feast and my friend hermione should be awake by now dobby threw his arms around harrys middle and hugged him harry potter is greater by far than dobby knew he sobbed farewell harry potter and with a final loud crack dobby disappeared harry had been to several hogwarts feasts but never one quite like this everybody was in their pajamas and the celebration lasted all night harry didnt know whether the best bit was hermione running toward him screaming you solved it you solved it or justin hurrying over from the hufflepuff table to wring his hand and apologize endlessly for suspecting him or hagrid turning up at half past three cuffing harry and ron so hard on the shoulders that they were knocked into their plates of trifle or his and rons four hundred points for gryffindor securing the house cup for the second year running or professor mcgonagall standing up to tell them all that the exams had been canceled as a school treat oh no said hermione or dumbledore announcing that unfortunately professor lockhart would be unable to return next year owing to the fact that he needed to go away and get his memory back quite a few of the teachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news shame said ron helping himself to a jam doughnut he was starting to grow on me the rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing sunshine hogwarts was back to normal with only a few small differences defense against the dark arts classes were canceled but weve had plenty of practice at that anyway ron told a disgruntled hermione and lucius malfoy had been sacked as a school governor draco was no longer strutting around the school as though he owned the place on the contrary he looked resentful and sulky on the other hand ginny weasley was perfectly happy again too soon it was time for the journey home on the hogwarts express harry ron hermione fred george and ginny got a compartment to themselves they made the most of the last few hours in which they were allowed to do magic before the holidays they played exploding snap set off the very last of fred and georges filibuster fireworks and practiced disarming each other by magic harry was getting very good at it they were almost at kings cross when harry remembered something ginny what did you see percy doing that he didnt want you to tell anyone oh that said ginny giggling well percys got a girlfriend fred dropped a stack of books on georges head what its that ravenclaw prefect penelope clearwater said ginny thats who he was writing to all last summer hes been meeting her all over the school in secret i walked in on them kissing in an empty classroom one day he was so upset when she was you know attacked you wont tease him will you she added anxiously wouldnt dream of it said fred who was looking like his birthday had come early definitely not said george sniggering the hogwarts express slowed and finally stopped harry pulled out his quill and a bit of parchment and turned to ron and hermione this is called a telephone number he told ron scribbling it twice tearing the parchment in two and handing it to them i told your dad how to use a telephone last summer hell know call me at the dursleys okay i cant stand another two months with only dudley to talk to your aunt and uncle will be proud though wont they said hermione as they got off the train and joined the crowd thronging toward the enchanted barrier when they hear what you did this year proud said harry are you crazy all those times i couldve died and i didnt manage it theyll be furious and together they walked back through the gateway to the muggle world end  chapter oneowl post harry potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways for one thing he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year for another he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret in the dead of night and he also happened to be a wizard it was nearly midnight and he was lying on his stomach in bed the blankets drawn right over his head like a tent a flashlight in one hand and a large leatherbound book a history of magic by bathilda bagshot propped open against the pillow harry moved the tip of his eaglefeather quill down the page frowning as he looked for something that would help him write his essay witch burning in the fourteenth century was completely pointless discuss the quill paused at the top of a likelylooking paragraph harry pushed his round glasses up the bridge of his nose moved his flashlight closer to the book and read nonmagic people more commonly known as muggles were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times but not very good at recognizing it on the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard burning had no effect whatsoever the witch or wizard would perform a basic flame freezing charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a gentle tickling sensation indeed wendelin the weird enjoyed being burned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less than forty seven times in various disguises harry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of parchment slowly and very carefully he unscrewed the ink bottle dipped his quill into it and began to write pausing every now and then to listen because if any of the dursleys heard the scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom hed probably find himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for the rest of the summer the dursley family of number four privet drive was the reason that harry never enjoyed his summer holidays uncle vernon aunt petunia and their son dudley were harrys only living relatives they were muggles and they had a very medieval attitude toward magic harrys dead parents who had been a witch and wizard themselves were never mentioned under the dursleys roof for years aunt petunia and uncle vernon had hoped that if they kept harry as downtrodden as possible they would be able to squash the magic out of him to their fury they had been unsuccessful these days they lived in terror of anyone finding out that harry had spent most of the last two years at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry the most they could do however was to lock away harrys spellbooks wand cauldron and broomstick at the start of the summer break and forbid him to talk to the neighbors this separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for harry because his teachers at hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work one of the essays a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions was for harrys least favorite teacher professor snape who would be delighted to have an excuse to give harry detention for a month harry had therefore seized his chance in the first week of the holidays while uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley had gone out into the front garden to admire uncle vernons new company car in very loud voices so that the rest of the street would notice it too harry had crept downstairs picked the lock on the cupboard under the stairs grabbed some of his books and hidden them in his bedroom as long as he didnt leave spots of ink on the sheets the dursleys need never know that he was studying magic by night harry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his aunt and uncle at the moment as they were already in an especially bad mood with him all because hed received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one week into the school vacation ron weasley who was one of harrys best friends at hogwarts came from a whole family of wizards this meant that he knew a lot of things harry didnt but had never used a telephone before most unluckily it had been uncle vernon who had answered the call vernon dursley speaking harry who happened to be in the room at the time froze as he heard rons voice answer hello hello can you hear me i want to talk to harry potter ron was yelling so loudly that uncle vernon jumped and held the receiver a foot away from his ear staring at it with an expression of mingled fury and alarm who is this he roared in the direction of the mouthpiece who are you ron weasley ron bellowed back as though he and uncle vernon were speaking from opposite ends of a football field im a friend of harrys from school uncle vernons small eyes swiveled around to harry who was rooted to the spot there is no harry potter here he roared now holding the receiver at arms length as though frightened it might explode i dont know what school youre talking about never contact me again dont you come near my family and he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if dropping a poisonous spider the fight that had followed had been one of the worst ever how dare you give this number to people like people like you uncle vernon had roared spraying harry with spit ron obviously realized that hed gotten harry into trouble because he hadnt called again harrys other best friend from hogwarts hermione granger hadnt been in touch either harry suspected that ron had warned hermione not to call which was a pity because hermione the cleverest witch in harrys year had muggle parents knew perfectly well how to use a telephone and would probably have had enough sense not to say that she went to hogwarts so harry had had no word from any of his wizarding friends for five long weeks and this summer was turning out to be almost as bad as the last one there was just one very small improvement after swearing that he wouldnt use her to send letters to any of his friends harry had been allowed to let his owl hedwig out at night uncle vernon had given in because of the racket hedwig made if she was locked in her cage all the time harry finished writing about wendelin the weird and paused to listen again the silence in the dark house was broken only by the distant grunting snores of his enormous cousin dudley it must be very late harry thought his eyes were itching with tiredness perhaps hed finish this essay tomorrow night he replaced the top of the ink bottle pulled an old pillowcase from under his bed put the flashlight a history of magic his essay quill and ink inside it got out of bed and hid the lot under a loose floorboard under his bed then he stood up stretched and checked the time on the luminous alarm clock on his bedside table it was one oclock in the morning harrys stomach gave a funny jolt he had been thirteen years old without realizing it for a whole hour yet another unusual thing about harry was how little he looked forward to his birthdays he had never received a birthday card in his life the dursleys had completely ignored his last two birthdays and he had no reason to suppose they would remember this one harry walked across the dark room past hedwigs large empty cage to the open window he leaned on the sill the cool night air pleasant on his face after a long time under the blankets hedwig had been absent for two nights now harry wasnt worried about her shed been gone this long before but he hoped shed be back soon she was the only living creature in this house who didnt flinch at the sight of him harry though still rather small and skinny for his age had grown a few inches over the last year his jetblack hair however was just as it always had been stubbornly untidy whatever he did to it the eyes behind his glasses were bright green and on his forehead clearly visible through his hair was a thin scar shaped like a bolt of lightning of all the unusual things about harry this scar was the most extraordinary of all it was not as the dursleys had pretended for ten years a souvenir of the car crash that had killed harrys parents because lily and james potter had not died in a car crash they had been murdered murdered by the most feared dark wizard for a hundred years lord voldemort harry had escaped from the same attack with nothing more than a scar on his forehead where voldemorts curse instead of killing him had rebounded upon its originator barely alive voldemort had fled but harry had come facetoface with him at hogwarts remembering their last meeting as he stood at the dark window harry had to admit he was lucky even to have reached his thirteenth birthday he scanned the starry sky for a sign of hedwig perhaps soaring back to him with a dead mouse dangling from her beak expecting praise gazing absently over the rooftops it was a few seconds before harry realized what he was seeing silhouetted against the golden moon and growing larger every moment was a large strangely lopsided creature and it was flapping in harrys direction he stood quite still watching it sink lower and lower for a split second he hesitated his hand on the window latch wondering whether to slam it shut but then the bizarre creature soared over one of the street lamps of privet drive and harry realizing what it was leapt aside through the window soared three owls two of them holding up the third which appeared to be unconscious they landed with a soft flump on harrys bed and the middle owl which was large and gray keeled right over and lay motionless there was a large package tied to its legs harry recognized the unconscious owl at once his name was errol and he belonged to the weasley family harry dashed to the bed untied the cords around errols legs took off the parcel and then carried errol to hedwigs cage errol opened one bleary eye gave a feeble hoot of thanks and began to gulp some water harry turned back to the remaining owls one of them the large snowy female was his own hedwig she too was carrying a parcel and looked extremely pleased with herself she gave harry an affectionate nip with her beak as he removed her burden then flew across the room to join errol harry didnt recognize the third owl a handsome tawny one but he knew at once where it had come from because in addition to a third package it was carrying a letter bearing the hogwarts crest when harry relieved this owl of its burden it ruffled its feathers importantly stretched its wings and took off through the window into the night harry sat down on his bed and grabbed errols package ripped off the brown paper and discovered a present wrapped in gold and his first ever birthday card fingers trembling slightly he opened the envelope two pieces of paper fell out a letter and a newspaper clipping the clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding newspaper the daily prophet because the people in the blackandwhite picture were moving harry picked up the clipping smoothed it out and read ministry of magic employee scoops grand prize arthur weasley head of the misuse of muggle artifacts office at the ministry of magic has won the annual daily prophet grand prize galleon draw a delighted mr weasley told the daily prophet we will be spending the gold on a summer holiday in egypt where our eldest son bill works as a curse breaker for gringotts wizarding bank the weasley family will be spending a month in egypt returning for the start of the new school year at hogwarts which five of the weasley children currently attend harry scanned the moving photograph and a grin spread across his face as he saw all nine of the weasleys waving furiously at him standing in front of a large pyramid plump little mrs weasley tall balding mr weasley six sons and one daughter all though the blackandwhite picture didnt show it with flamingred hair right in the middle of the picture was ron tall and gangling with his pet rat scabbers on his shoulder and his arm around his little sister ginny harry couldnt think of anyone who deserved to win a large pile of gold more than the weasleys who were very nice and extremely poor he picked up rons letter and unfolded it dear harry happy birthday look im really sorry about that telephone call i hope the muggles didnt give you a hard time i asked dad and he reckons i shouldnt have shouted its amazing here in egypt bills taken us around all the tombs and you wouldnt believe the curses those old egyptian wizards put on them mum wouldnt let ginny come in the last one there were all these mutant skeletons in there of muggles whod broken in and grown extra heads and stuff i couldnt believe it when dad won the daily prophet draw seven hundred galleons most of its gone on this trip but theyre going to buy me a new wand for next year harry remembered only too well the occasion when rons old wand had snapped it had happened when the car the two of them had been flying to hogwarts had crashed into a tree on the school grounds well be back about a week before term starts and well be going up to london to get my wand and our new books any chance of meeting you there dont let the muggles get you down try and come to london ron ps percys head boy he got the letter last week harry glanced back at the photograph percy who was in his seventh and final year at hogwarts was looking particularly smug he had pinned his head boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of his neat hair his hornrimmed glasses flashing in the egyptian sun harry now turned to his present and unwrapped it inside was what looked like a miniature glass spinning top there was another note from ron beneath it harry this is a pocket sneakoscope if theres someone untrustworthy around its supposed to light up and spin bill says its rubbish sold for wizard tourists and isnt reliable because it kept lighting up at dinner last night but he didnt realize fred and george had put beetles in his soup bye ron harry put the pocket sneakoscope on his bedside table where it stood quite still balanced on its point reflecting the luminous hands of his clock he looked at it happily for a few seconds then picked up the parcel hedwig had brought inside this too there was a wrapped present a card and a letter this time from hermione dear harry ron wrote to me and told me about his phone call to your uncle vernon i do hope youre all right im on holiday in france at the moment and i didnt know how i was going to send this to you what if theyd opened it at customs but then hedwig turned up i think she wanted to make sure you got something for your birthday for a change i bought your present by owlorder there was an advertisement in the daily prophet ive been getting it delivered its so good to keep up with whats going on in the wizarding world did you see that picture of ron and his family a week ago i bet hes learning loads im really jealous the ancient egyptian wizards were fascinating theres some interesting local history of witchcraft here too ive rewritten my whole history of magic essay to include some of the things ive found out i hope its not too long its two rolls of parchment more than professor binns asked for ron says hes going to be in london in the last week of the holidays can you make it will your aunt and uncle let you come i really hope you can if not ill see you on the hogwarts express on september first love from hermione ps ron says percys head boy ill bet percys really pleased ron doesnt seem too happy about it harry laughed as he put herrmones letter aside and picked up her present it was very heavy knowing hermione he was sure it would be a large book full of very difficult spells but it wasnt his heart gave a huge bound as he ripped back the paper and saw a sleek black leather case with silver words stamped across it reading broomstick servicing kit wow hermione harry whispered unzipping the case to look inside there was a large jar of fleetwoods highfinish handle polish a pair of gleaming silver talltwig clippers a tiny brass compass to clip on your broom for long journeys and a handbook of doityourself broomcare apart from his friends the thing that harry missed most about hogwarts was quidditch the most popular sport in the magical world highly dangerous very exciting and played on broomsticks harry happened to be a very good quidditch player he had been the youngest person in a century to be picked for one of the hogwarts house teams one of harrys most prized possessions was his nimbus two thousand racing broom harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel he recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once this was from hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper he tore off the top layer of paper and glimpsed something green and leathery but before he could unwrap it properly the parcel gave a strange quiver and whatever was inside it snapped loudly as though it had jaws harry froze he knew that hagrid would never send him anything dangerous on purpose but then hagrid didnt have a normal persons view of what was dangerous hagrid had been known to befriend giant spiders buy vicious threeheaded dogs from men in pubs and sneak illegal dragon eggs into his cabin harry poked the parcel nervously it snapped loudly again harry reached for the lamp on his bedside table gripped it firmly in one hand and raised it over his head ready to strike then he seized the rest of the wrapping paper in his other hand and pulled and out fell a book harry just had time to register its handsome green cover emblazoned with the golden title the monster book of monsters before it flipped onto its edge and scuttled sideways along the bed like some weird crab uhoh harry muttered the book toppled off the bed with a loud clunk and shuffled rapidly across the room harry followed it stealthily the book was hiding in the dark space under his desk praying that the dursleys were still fast asleep harry got down on his hands and knees and reached toward it ouch the book snapped shut on his hand and then flapped past him still scuttling on its covers harry scrambled around threw himself forward and managed to flatten it uncle vernon gave a loud sleepy grunt in the room next door hedwig and errol watched interestedly as harry clamped the struggling book tightly in his arms hurried to his chest of drawers and pulled out a belt which he buckled tightly around it the monster book shuddered angrily but could no longer flap and snap so harry threw it down on the bed and reached for hagrids card dear harry happy birthday think you might find this useful for next year wont say no more here tell you when i see you hope the muggles are treating you right all the best hagrid it struck harry as ominous that hagrid thought a biting book would come in useful but he put hagrids card up next to rons and hermiones grinning more broadly than ever now there was only the letter from hogwarts left noticing that it was rather thicker than usual harry slit open the envelope pulled out the first page of parchment within and read dear mr potter please note that the new school year will begin on september the first the hogwarts express will leave ftom kings cross station platform nine and threequarters at eleven oclock third years are permitted to visit the village of hogsmeade on certain weekends please give the enclosed permission form to your parent or guardian to sign a list of books for next year is enclosed yours sincerely professor m mcgonagall deputy headmistress harry pulled out the hogsmeade permission form and looked at it no longer grinning it would be wonderful to visit hogsmeade on weekends he knew it was an entirely wizarding village and he had never set foot there but how on earth was he going to persuade uncle vernon or aunt petunia to sign the form he looked over at the alarm clock it was now two oclock in the morning deciding that hed worry about the hogsmeade form when he woke up harry got back into bed and reached up to cross off another day on the chart hed made for himself counting down the days left until his return to hogwarts then he took off his glasses and lay down eyes open facing his three birthday cards extremely unusual though he was at that moment harry potter felt just like everyone else glad for the first time in his life that it was his birthday chapter two aunt marges big mistake harry went down to breakfast the next morning to find the three dursleys already sitting around the kitchen table they were watching a brandnew television a welcomehomeforthesummer present for dudley who had been complaining loudly about the long walk between the fridge and the television in the living room dudley had spent most of the summer in the kitchen his piggy little eyes fixed on the screen and his five chins wobbling as he ate continually harry sat down between dudley and uncle vernon a large beefy man with very little neck and a lot of mustache far from wishing harry a happy birthday none of the dursleys made any sign that they had noticed harry enter the room but harry was far too used to this to care he helped himself to a piece of toast and then looked up at the reporter on the television who was halfway through a report on an escaped convict the public is warned that black is armed and extremely dangerous a special hot line has been set up and any sighting of black should be reported immediately no need to tell us hes no good snorted uncle vernon staring over the top of his newspaper at the prisoner look at the state of him the filthy layabout look at his hair he shot a nasty look sideways at harry whose untidy hair had always been a source of great annoyance to uncle vernon compared to the man on the television however whose gaunt face was surrounded by a matted elbowlength tangle harry felt very well groomed indeed the reporter had reappeared the ministry of agriculture and fisheries will announce today hang on barked uncle vernon staring furiously at the reporter you didnt tell us where that maniacs escaped from what use is that lunatic could be coming up the street right now aunt petunia who was bony and horsefaced whipped around and peered intently out of the kitchen window harry knew aunt petunia would simply love to be the one to call the hot line number she was the nosiest woman in the world and spent most of her life spying on the boring lawabiding neighbors when will they learn said uncle vernon pounding the table with his large purple fist that hangings the only way to deal with these people very true said aunt petunia who was still squinting into next doors runner beans uncle vernon drained his teacup glanced at his watch and added id better be off in a minute petunia marges train gets in at ten harry whose thoughts had been upstairs with the broomstick servicing kit was brought back to earth with an unpleasant bump aunt marge he blurted out sh shes not coming here is she aunt marge was uncle vernons sister even though she was not a blood relative of harrys whose mother had been aunt petunias sister he had been forced to call her aunt all his life aunt marge lived in the country in a house with a large garden where she bred bulldogs she didnt often stay at privet drive because she couldnt bear to leave her precious dogs but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in harrys mind at dudleys fifth birthday party aunt marge had whacked harry around the shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating dudley at musical statues a few years later she had turned up at christmas with a computerized robot for dudley and a box of dog biscuits for harry on her last visit the year before harry started at hogwarts harry had accidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog ripper had chased harry out into the garden and up a tree and aunt marge had refused to call him off until past midnight the memory of this incident still brought tears of laughter to dudleys eyes margell be here for a week uncle vernon snarled and while were on the subject he pointed a fat finger threateningly at harry we need to get a few things straight before i go and collect her dudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television watching harry being bullied by uncle vernon was dudleys favorite form of entertainment firstly growled uncle vernon youll keep a civil tongue in your head when youre talking to marge all right said harry bitterly if she does when shes talking to me secondly said uncle vernon acting as though he had not heard harrys reply as marge doesnt know anything about your abnormality i dont want any any funny stuff while shes here you behave yourself got me i will if she does said harry through gritted teeth and thirdly said uncle vernon his mean little eyes now slits in his great purple face weve told marge you attend st brutuss secure center for incurably criminal boys what harry yelled and youll be sticking to that story boy or therell be trouble spat uncle vernon harry sat there whitefaced and furious staring at uncle vernon hardly able to believe it aunt marge coming for a weeklong visit it was the worst birthday present the dursleys had ever given him including that pair of uncle vernons old socks well petunia said uncle vernon getting heavily to his feet ill be off to the station then want to come along for the ride dudders no said dudley whose attention had returned to the television now that uncle vernon had finished threatening harry duddys got to make himself smart for his auntie said aunt petunia smoothing dudleys thick blond hair mummys bought him a lovely new bow tie uncle vernon clapped dudley on his porky shoulder see you in a bit then he said and he left the kitchen harry who had been sitting in a kind of horrified trance had a sudden idea abandoning his toast he got quickly to his feet and followed uncle vernon to the front door uncle vernon was pulling on his car coat im not taking you he snarled as he turned to see harry watching him like i wanted to come said harry coldly i want to ask you something uncle vernon eyed him suspiciously third years at hog at my school are allowed to visit the village sometimes said harry so snapped uncle vernon taking his car keys from a hook next to the door i need you to sign the permission form said harry in a rush and why should i do that sneered uncle vernon well said harry choosing his words carefully itll be hard work pretending to aunt marge i go to that st whats it st brutuss secure center for incurably criminal boys bellowed uncle vernon and harry was pleased to hear a definite note of panic in uncle vernons voice exactly said harry looking calmly up into uncle vernons large purple face its a lot to remember ill have to make it sound convincing wont i what if i accidentally let something slip youll get the stuffing knocked out of you wont you roared uncle vernon advancing on harry with his fist raised but harry stood his ground knocking the stuffing out of me wont make aunt marge forget what i could tell her he said grimly uncle vernon stopped his fist still raised his face an ugly puce but if you sign my permission form harry went on quickly i swear ill remember where im supposed to go to school and ill act like a mug like im normal and everything harry could tell that uncle vernon was thinking it over even if his teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in his temple right he snapped finally i shall monitor your behavior carefully during marges visit if at the end of it youve toed the line and kept to the story ill sign your ruddy form he wheeled around pulled open the front door and slammed it so hard that one of the little panes of glass at the top fell out harry didnt return to the kitchen he went back upstairs to his bedroom if he was going to act like a real muggle hed better start now slowly and sadly he gathered up all his presents and his birthday cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with his homework then he went to hedwigs cage errol seemed to have recovered he and hedwig were both asleep heads under their wings harry sighed then poked them both awake hedwig he said gloomily youre going to have to clear off for a week go with errol ronll look after you ill write him a note explaining and dont look at me like that hedwigs large amber eyes were reproachful its not my fault its the only way ill be allowed to visit hogsmeade with ron and hermione ten minutes later errol and hedwig who had a note to ron bound to her leg soared out of the window and out of sight harry now feeling thoroughly miserable put the empty cage away inside the wardrobe but harry didnt have long to brood in next to no time aunt petunia was shrieking up the stairs for harry to come down and get ready to welcome their guest do something about your hair aunt petunia snapped as he reached the hall harry couldnt see the point of trying to make his hair lie flat aunt marge loved criticizing him so the untidier he looked the happier she would be all too soon there was a crunch of gravel outside as uncle vernons car pulled back into the driveway then the clunk of the car doors and footsteps on the garden path get the door aunt petunia hissed at harry a feeling of great gloom in his stomach harry pulled the door open on the threshold stood aunt marge she was very like uncle vernon large beefy and purple faced she even had a mustache though not as bushy as his in one hand she held an enormous suitcase and tucked under the other was an old and eviltempered bulldog wheres my dudders roared aunt marge wheres my neffypoo dudley came waddling down the hall his blond hair plastered flat to his fat head a bow tie just visible under his many chins aunt marge thrust the suitcase into harrys stomach knocking the wind out of him seized dudley in a tight onearmed hug and planted a large kiss on his cheek harry knew perfectly well that dudley only put up with aunt marges hugs because he was well paid for it and sure enough when they broke apart dudley had a crisp twentypound note clutched in his fat fist petunia shouted aunt marge striding past harry as though he was a hat stand aunt marge and aunt petunia kissed or rather aunt marge bumped her large jaw against aunt petunias bony cheekbone uncle vernon now came in smiling jovially as he shut the door tea marge he said and what will ripper take ripper can have some tea out of my saucer said aunt marge as they all proceeded into the kitchen leaving harry alone in the hall with the suitcase but harry wasnt complaining any excuse not to be with aunt marge was fine by him so he began to heave the case upstairs into the spare bedroom taking as long as he could by the time he got back to the kitchen aunt marge had been supplied with tea and fruitcake and ripper was lapping noisily in the corner harry saw aunt petunia wince slightly as specks of tea and drool flecked her clean floor aunt petunia hated animals whos looking after the other dogs marge uncle vernon asked oh ive got colonel fubster managing them boomed aunt marge hes retired now good for him to have something to do but i couldnt leave poor old ripper he pines if hes away from me ripper began to growl again as harry sat down this directed aunt marges attention to harry for the first time so she barked still here are you yes said harry dont you say yes in that ungrateful tone aunt marge growled its damn good of vernon and petunia to keep you wouldnt have done it myself youd have gone straight to an orphanage if youd been dumped on my doorstep harry was bursting to say that hed rather live in an orphanage than with the dursleys but the thought of the hogsmeade form stopped him he forced his face into a painful smile dont you smirk at me boomed aunt marge i can see you havent improved since i last saw you i hoped school would knock some manners into you she took a large gulp of tea wiped her mustache and said where is it that you send him again vernon st brutuss said uncle vernon promptly its a firstrate institution for hopeless cases i see said aunt marge do they use the cane at st brutuss boy she barked across the table er uncle vernon nodded curtly behind aunt marges back yes said harry then feeling he might as well do the thing properly he added all the time excellent said aunt marge i wont have this nambypamby wishywashy nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it a good thrashing is whats needed in ninetynine cases out of a hundred have you been beaten often oh yeah said harry loads of times aunt marge narrowed her eyes i still dont like your tone boy she said if you can speak of your beatings in that casual way they clearly arent hitting you hard enough petunia id write if i were you make it clear that you approve the use of extreme force in this boys case perhaps uncle vernon was worried that harry might forget their bargainin any case he changed the subject abruptly heard the news this morning marge what about that escaped prisoner eh as aunt marge started to make herself at home harry caught himself thinking almost longingly of life at number four without her uncle vernon and aunt petunia usually encouraged harry to stay out of their way which harry was only too happy to do aunt marge on the other hand wanted harry under her eye at all times so that she could boom out suggestions for his improvement she delighted in comparing harry with dudley and took huge pleasure in buying dudley expensive presents while glaring at harry as though daring him to ask why he hadnt got a present too she also kept throwing out dark hints about what made harry such an unsatisfactory person you mustnt blame yourself for the way the boys turned out vernon she said over lunch on the third day if theres something rotten on the inside theres nothing anyone can do about it harry tried to concentrate on his food but his hands shook and his face was starting to burn with anger remember the form he told himself think about hogsmeade dont say anything dont rise aunt marge reached for her glass of wine its one of the basic rules of breeding she said you see it all the time with dogs if theres something wrong with the bitch therell be something wrong with the pup at that moment the wineglass aunt marge was holding exploded in her hand shards of glass flew in every direction and aunt marge sputtered and blinked her great ruddy face dripping marge squealed aunt petunia marge are you all right not to worry grunted aunt marge mopping her face with her napkin must have squeezed it too hard did the same thing at colonel fubsters the other day no need to fuss petunia i have a very firm grip but aunt petunia and uncle vernon were both looking at harry suspiciously so he decided hed better skip dessert and escape from the table as soon as he could outside in the hall he leaned against the wall breathing deeply it had been a long time since hed lost control and made something explode he couldnt afford to let it happen again the hogsmeade form wasnt the only thing at stake if he carried on like that hed be in trouble with the ministry of magic harry was still an underage wizard and he was forbidden by wizard law to do magic outside school his record wasnt exactly clean either only last summer hed gotten an official warning that had stated quite clearly that if the ministry got wind of any more magic in privet drive harry would face expulsion from hogwarts he heard the dursleys leaving the table and hurried upstairs out of the way harry got through the next three days by forcing himself to think about his handbook of doityourself broomcare whenever aunt marge started on him this worked quite well though it seemed to give him a glazed look because aunt marge started voicing the opinion that he was mentally subnormal at last at long last the final evening of marges stay arrived aunt petunia cooked a fancy dinner and uncle vernon uncorked several bottles of wine they got all the way through the soup and the salmon without a single mention of harrys faults during the lemon meringue pie uncle vernon bored them with a long talk about grunnings his drillmaking company then aunt petunia made coffee and uncle vernon brought out a bottle of brandy can i tempt you marge aunt marge had already had quite a lot of wine her huge face was very red just a small one then she chuckled a bit more than that and a bit more thats the ticket dudley was eating his fourth slice of pie aunt petunia was sipping coffee with her little finger sticking out harry really wanted to disappear into his bedroom but he met uncle vernons angry little eyes and knew he would have to sit it out aah said aunt marge smacking her lips and putting the empty brandy glass back down excellent nosh petunia its normally just a fryup for me of an evening with twelve dogs to look after she burped richly and patted her great tweed stomach pardon me but i do like to see a healthysized boy she went on winking at dudley youll be a propersized man dudders like your father yes ill have a spot more brandy vernon now this one here she jerked her head at harry who felt his stomach clench the handbook he thought quickly this ones got a mean runty look about him you get that with dogs i had colonel fubster drown one last year ratty little thing it was weak underbred harry was trying to remember page twelve of his book a charm to cure reluctant reversers it all comes down to blood as i was saying the other day bad blood will out now im saying nothing against your family petunia she patted aunt petunias bony hand with her shovellike one but your sister was a bad egg they turn up in the best families then she ran off with a wastrel and heres the result right in front of us harry was staring at his plate a funny ringing in his ears grasp your broom firmly by the tail he thought but he couldnt remember what came next aunt marges voice seemed to be boring into him like one of uncle vernons drills this potter said aunt marge loudly seizing the brandy bottle and splashing more into her glass and over the tablecloth you never told me what he did uncle vernon and aunt petunia were looking extremely tense dudley had even looked up from his pie to gape at his parents he didnt work said uncle vernon with half a glance at harry unemployed as i expected said aunt marge taking a huge swig of brandy and wiping her chin on her sleeve a noaccount goodfornothing lazy scrounger who he was not said harry suddenly the table went very quiet harry was shaking all over he had never felt so angry in his life more brandy yelled uncle vernon who had gone very white he emptied the bottle into aunt marges glass you boy he snarled at harry go to bed go on no vernon hiccuped aunt marge holding up a hand her tiny bloodshot eyes fixed on harrys go on boy go on proud of your parents are you they go and get themselves killed in a car crash drunk i expect they didnt die in a car crash said harry who found himself on his feet they died in a car crash you nasty little liar and left you to be a burden on their decent hardworking relatives screamed aunt marge swelling with fury you are an insolent ungrateful little but aunt marge suddenly stopped speaking for a moment it looked as though words had failed her she seemed to be swelling with inexpressible anger but the swelling didnt stop her great red face started to expand her tiny eyes bulged and her mouth stretched too tightly for speech next second several buttons had just burst from her tweed jacket and pinged off the walls she was inflating like a monstrous balloon her stomach bursting free of her tweed waistband each of her fingers blowing up like a salami marge yelled uncle vernon and aunt petunia together as aunt marges whole body began to rise off her chair toward the ceiling she was entirely round now like a vast life buoy with piggy eyes and her hands and feet stuck out weirdly as she drifted up into the air making apoplectic popping noises ripper came skidding into the room barking madly nooooooo uncle vernon seized one of marges feet and tried to pull her down again but was almost lifted from the floor himself a second later ripper leapt forward and sank his teeth into uncle vernons leg harry tore from the dining room before anyone could stop him heading for the cupboard under the stairs the cupboard door burst magically open as he reached it in seconds he had heaved his trunk to the front door he sprinted upstairs and threw himself under the bed wrenching up the loose floorboard and grabbed the pillowcase full of his books and birthday presents he wriggled out seized hedwigs empty cage and dashed back downstairs to his trunk just as uncle vernon burst out of the dining room his trouser leg in bloody tatters come back in here he bellowed come back and put her right but a reckless rage had come over harry he kicked his trunk open pulled out his wand and pointed it at uncle vernon she deserved it harry said breathing very fast she deserved what she got you keep away from me he fumbled behind him for the latch on the door im going harry said ive had enough and in the next moment he was out in the dark quiet street heaving his heavy trunk behind him hedwigs cage under his arm chapter three the knight bus harry was several streets away before he collapsed onto a low wall in magnolia crescent panting from the effort of dragging his trunk he sat quite still anger still surging through him listening to the frantic thumping of his heart but after ten minutes alone in the dark street a new emotion overtook him panic whichever way he looked at it he had never been in a worse fix he was stranded quite alone in the dark muggle world with absolutely nowhere to go and the worst of it was he had just done serious magic which meant that he was almost certainly expelled from hogwarts he had broken the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry so badly he was surprised ministry of magic representatives werent swooping down on him where he sat harry shivered and looked up and down magnolia crescent what was going to happen to him would he be arrested or would he simply be outlawed from the wizarding world he thought of ron and hermione and his heart sank even lower harry was sure that criminal or not ron and hermione would want to help him now but they were both abroad and with hedwig gone he had no means of contacting them he didnt have any muggle money either there was a little wizard gold in the money bag at the bottom of his trunk but the rest of the fortune his parents had left him was stored in a vault at gringotts wizarding bank in london hed never be able to drag his trunk all the way to london unless he looked down at his wand which he was still clutching in his hand if he was already expelled his heart was now thumping painfully fast a bit more magic couldnt hurt he had the invisibility cloak he had inherited from his father what if he bewitched the trunk to make it featherlight tied it to his broomstick covered himself in the cloak and flew to london then he could get the rest of his money out of his vault and begin his life as an outcast it was a horrible prospect but he couldnt sit on this wall forever or hed find himself trying to explain to muggle police why he was out in the dead of night with a trunkful of spellbooks and a broomstick harry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside looking for the invisibility cloak but before he had found it he straightened up suddenly looking around him once more a funny prickling on the back of his neck had made harry feel he was being watched but the street appeared to be deserted and no lights shone from any of the large square houses he bent over his trunk again but almost immediately stood up once more his hand clenched on his wand he had sensed rather than heard it someone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garage and the fence behind him harry squinted at the black alleyway if only it would move then hed know whether it was just a stray cat or something else lumos harry muttered and a light appeared at the end of his wand almost dazzling him he held it high over his head and the pebbledashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled the garage door gleamed and between them harry saw quite distinctly the hulking outline of something very big with wide gleaming eyes harry stepped backward his legs hit his trunk and he tripped his wand flew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall and he landed hard in the gutter there was a deafening bang and harry threw up his hands to shield his eyes against a sudden blinding light with a yell he rolled back onto the pavement just in time a second later a gigantic pair of wheels and headlights screeched to a halt exactly where harry had just been lying they belonged as harry saw when he raised his head to a tripledecker violently purple bus which had appeared out of thin air gold lettering over the windshield spelled the knight bus for a split second harry wondered if he had been knocked silly by his fall then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus and began to speak loudly to the night welcome to the knight bus emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard just stick out your wand hand step on board and we can take you anywhere you want to go my name is stan shunpike and i will be your conductor this eve the conductor stopped abruptly he had just caught sight of harry who was still sitting on the ground harry snatched up his wand again and scrambled to his feet close up he saw that stan shunpike was only a few years older than he was eighteen or nineteen at most with large protruding ears and quite a few pimples what were you doin down there said stan dropping his professional manner fell over said harry choo fall over for sniggered stan i didnt do it on purpose said harry annoyed one of the knees in his jeans was torn and the hand he had thrown out to break his fall was bleeding he suddenly remembered why he had fallen over and turned around quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fence the knight buss headlamps were flooding it with light and it was empty choo lookin at said stan there was a big black thing said harry pointing uncertainly into the gap like a dog but massive he looked around at stan whose mouth was slightly open with a feeling of unease harry saw stans eyes move to the scar on harrys forehead woss that on your ead said stan abruptly nothing said harry quickly flattening his hair over his scar if the ministry of magic was looking for him he didnt want to make it too easy for them woss your name stan persisted neville longbottom said harry saying the first name that came into his head so so this bus he went on quickly hoping to distract stan did you say it goes anywhere yep said stan proudly anywhere you like longs its on land cant do nuffink underwater ere he said looking suspicious again you did flag us down dincha stuck out your wand and dincha yes said harry quickly listen how much would it be to get to london eleven sickles said stan but for fifteen you get or chocolate and for fifteen you get an ot water bottle an a toofbrush in the colour of your choice harry rummaged once more in his trunk extracted his money bag and shoved some gold into stans hand he and stan then lifted his trunk with hedwigs cage balanced on top up the steps of the bus there were no seats instead half a dozen brass bedsteads stood beside the curtained windows candles were burning in brackets beside each bed illuminating the woodpaneled walls a tiny wizard in a nightcap at the rear of the bus muttered not now thanks im pickling some slugs and rolled over in his sleep you ave this one stan whispered shoving harrys trunk under the bed right behind the driver who was sitting in an armchair in front of the steering wheel this is our driver ernie prang this is neville longbottom ern ernie prang an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses nodded to harry who nervously flattened his bangs again and sat down on his bed take er away ern said stan sitting down in the armchair next to ernies there was another tremendous bang and the next moment harry found himself flat on his bed thrown backward by the speed of the knight bus pulling himself up harry stared out of the dark window and saw that they were now bowling along a completely different street stan was watching harrys stunned face with great enjoyment this is where we was before you flagged us down he said where are we ern somewhere in wales ar said ernie how come the muggles dont hear the bus said harry them said stan contemptuously don listen properly do they don look properly either never notice nuffink they don best go wake up madam marsh stan said ern well be in abergavenny in a minute stan passed harrys bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden staircase harry was still looking out of the window feeling increasingly nervous ernie didnt seem to have mastered the use of a steering wheel the knight bus kept mounting the pavement but it didnt hit anything lines of lampposts mailboxes and trash cans jumped out of its way as it approached and back into position once it had passed stan came back downstairs followed by a faintly green witch wrapped in a traveling cloak ere you go madam marsh said stan happily as ern stamped on the brake and the beds slid a foot or so toward the front of the bus madam marsh clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tottered down the steps stan threw her bag out after her and rammed the doors shut there was another loud bang and they were thundering down a narrow country lane trees leaping out of the way harry wouldnt have been able to sleep even if he had been traveling on a bus that didnt keep banging loudly and jumping a hundred miles at a time his stomach churned as he fell back to wondering what was going to happen to him and whether the dursleys had managed to get aunt marge off the ceiling yet stan had unfurled a copy of the daily prophet and was now reading with his tongue between his teeth a large photograph of a sunkenfaced man with long matted hair blinked slowly at harry from the front page he looked strangely familiar that man harry said forgetting his troubles for a moment he was on the muggle news stanley turned to the front page and chuckled sirius black he said nodding course e was on the muggle news neville where you been he gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on harrys face removed the front page and handed it to harry you oughta read the papers more neville harry held the paper up to the candlelight and read black still at large sirius black possibly the most infamous prisoner ever to be held in azkaban fortress is still eluding capture the ministry of magic confirmed today we are doing all we can to recapture black said the minister of magic cornelius fudge this morning and we beg the magical community to remain calm fudge has been criticized by some members of the international federation of warlocks for informing the muggle prime minister of the crisis well really i had to dont you know said an irritable fudge black is mad hes a danger to anyone who crosses him magic or muggle i have the prime ministers assurance that he will not breathe a word of blacks true identity to anyone and lets face itwhod believe him if he did while muggles have been told that black is carrying a gun a kind of metal wand that muggles use to kill each other the magical community lives in fear of a massacre like that of twelve years ago when black murdered thirteen people with a single curse harry looked into the shadowed eyes of sirius black the only part of the sunken face that seemed alive harry had never met a vampire but he had seen pictures of them in his defense against the dark arts classes and black with his waxy white skin looked just like one scarylookin fing inee said stan who had been watching harry read he murdered thirteen people said harry handing the page back to stan with one curse yep said stan in front of witnesses an all broad daylight big trouble it caused dinnit ern ar said ern darkly stan swiveled in his armchair his hands on the back the better to look at harry black woz a big supporter of youknowoo he said what voldemort said harry without thinking even stans pimples went white ern jerked the steering wheel so hard that a whole farmhouse had to jump aside to avoid the bus you outta your tree yelped stan choo say is name for sorry said harry hastily sorry i i forgot forgot said stan weakly blimey my earts goin that fast so so black was a supporter of youknowwho harry prompted apologetically yeah said stan still rubbing his chest yeah thats right very close to youknowoo they say anyway when little arry potter got the better of youknowoo harry nervously flattened his bangs down again all youknowoos supporters was tracked down wasnt they ern most of em knew it was all over wiv youknowoo gone and they came quiet but not sirius black i eard he thought

an so did a dozen muggles that got in the way orrible eh an you know what black did then stan continued in a dramatic whisper what said harry laughed said stan jus stood there an laughed an when reinforcements from the ministry of magic got there e went wiv em quiet as anyfink still laughing is ead off cos es mad inee ern inee mad if he werent then he went to azkaban he will be now said ern

before as there ern beats me ow e did it frightenin eh mind i dont fancy is chances against them azkaban guards eh ern ernie suddenly shivered talk about summat else stan theres a good lad them azkaban guards give me the collywobbles stan put the paper away reluctantly and harry leaned against the window of the knight bus feeling worse than ever he couldnt help imagining what stan might be telling his passengers in a few nights time ear about that arry potter blew up is aunt we ad im ere on the knight bus dint we ern e was tryin to run for it he harry had broken wizard law just like sirius black was inflating aunt marge bad enough to land him in azkaban harry didnt know anything about the wizard prison though everyone hed ever heard speak of it did so in the same fearful tone hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper had spent two months there only last year harry wouldnt soon forget the look of terror on hagrids face when he had been told where he was going and hagrid was one of the bravest people harry knew the knight bus rolled through the darkness scattering bushes and wastebaskets telephone booths and trees and harry lay restless and miserable on his feather bed after a while stan remembered that harry had paid for hot chocolate but poured it all over harrys pillow when the bus moved abruptly from anglesea to aberdeen one by one wizards and witches in dressing gowns and slippers descended from the upper floors to leave the bus they all looked very pleased to go finally harry was the only passenger left right then neville said stan clapping his hands where abouts in london diagon alley said harry righto said stan old tight then bang they were thundering along charing cross road harry sat up and watched buildings and benches squeezing themselves out of the knight buss way the sky was getting a little lighter he would lie low for a couple of hours go to gringotts the moment it opened then set off where he didnt know ern slammed on the brakes and the knight bus skidded to a halt in front of a small and shabby looking pub the leaky cauldron behind which lay the magical entrance to diagon alley thanks harry said to ern he jumped down the steps and helped stan lower his trunk and hedwigs cage onto the pavement well said harry bye then but stan wasnt paying attention still standing in the doorway to the bus he was goggling at the shadowy entrance to the leaky cauldron there you are harry said a voice before harry could turn he felt a hand on his shoulder at the same time stan shouted blimey ern come ere come ere harry looked up at the owner of the hand on his shoulder and felt a bucketful of ice cascade into his stomach he had walked right into cornelius fudge the minister of magic himself stan leapt onto the pavement beside them what didja call neville minister he said excitedly fudge a portly little man in a long pinstriped cloak looked cold and exhausted neville he repeated frowning this is harry potter i knew it stan shouted gleefully ern ern guess oo neville is ern es arry potter i can see is scar yes said fudge testily well im very glad the knight bus picked harry up but he and i need to step inside the leaky cauldron now fudge increased the pressure on harrys shoulder and harry found himself being steered inside the pub a stooping figure bearing a lantern appeared through the door behind the bar it was tom the wizened toothless landlord youve got him minister said tom will you be wanting anything beer brandy perhaps a pot of tea said fudge who still hadnt let go of harry there was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them and stan and ern appeared carrying harrys trunk and hedwigs cage and looking around excitedly ow come you dint tell us oo you are eh neville said stan beaming at harry while ernies owlish face peered interestedly over stans shoulder and a private parlor please tom said fudge pointedly bye harry said miserably to stan and ern as tom beckoned fudge toward the passage that led from the bar bye neville called stan fudge marched harry along the narrow passage after toms lantern and then into a small parlor tom clicked his fingers a fire burst into life in the grate and he bowed himself out of the room sit down harry said fudge indicating a chair by the fire harry sat down feeling goose bumps rising up his arms despite the glow of the fire fudge took off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside then hitched up the trousers of his bottlegreen suit and sat down opposite harry i am cornelius fudge harry the minister of magic harry already knew this of course he had seen fudge once before but as he had been wearing his fathers invisibility cloak at the time fudge wasnt to know that tom the innkeeper reappeared wearing an apron over his nightshirt and bearing a tray of tea and crumpets he placed the tray on a table between fudge and harry and left the parlor closing the door behind him well harry said fudge pouring out tea youve had us all in a right flap i dont mind telling you running away from your aunt and uncles house like that id started to think but youre safe and thats what matters fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward harry eat harry you look dead on your feet now then you will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate blowingup of miss marjorie dursley two members of the accidental magic reversal department were dispatched to privet drive a few hours ago miss dursley has been punctured and her memory has been modified she has no recollection of the incident at all so thats that and no harm done fudge smiled at harry over the rim of his teacup rather like an uncle surveying a favorite nephew harry who couldnt believe his ears opened his mouth to speak couldnt think of anything to say and closed it again ah youre worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle said fudge well i wont deny that they are extremely angry harry but they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at hogwarts for the christmas and easter holidays harry unstuck his throat i always stay at hogwarts for the christmas and easter holidays he said and i dont ever want to go back to privet drive now now im sure youll feel differently once youve calmed down said fudge in a worried tone they are your family after all and im sure you are fond of each other er very deep down it didnt occur to harry to put fudge right he was still waiting to hear what was going to happen to him now so all that remains said fudge now buttering himself a second crumpet is to decide where youre going to spend the last two weeks of your vacation i suggest you take a room here at the leaky cauldron and hang on blurted harry what about my punishment fudge blinked punishment i broke the law harry said the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry oh my dear boy were not going to punish you for a little thing like that cried fudge waving his crumpet impatiently it was an accident we dont send people to azkaban just for blowing up their aunts but this didnt tally at all with harrys past dealings with the ministry of magic last year i got an official warning just because a houseelf smashed a pudding in my uncles house he told fudge frowning the ministry of magic said id be expelled from hogwarts if there was any more magic there unless harrys eyes were deceiving him fudge was suddenly looking awkward circumstances change harry we have to take into account in the present climate surely you dont want to be expelled of course i dont said harry well then whats all the fuss about laughed fudge now have a crumpet harry while i go and see if toms got a room for you fudge strode out of the parlor and harry stared after him there was something extremely odd going on why had fudge been waiting for him at the leaky cauldron if not to punish him for what hed done and now harry came to think of it surely it wasnt usual for the minister of magic himself to get involved in matters of underage magic fudge came back accompanied by tom the innkeeper room elevens free harry said fudge i think youll be very comfortable just one thing and im sure youll understand i dont want you wandering off into muggle london all right keep to diagon alley and youre to be back here before dark each night sure youll understand tom will be keeping an eye on you for me okay said harry slowly but why dont want to lose you again do we said fudge with a hearty laugh no no best we know where you are i mean fudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his pinstriped cloak well ill be off plenty to do you know have you had any luck with black yet harry asked fudges finger slipped on the silver fastenings of his cloak whats that oh youve heard well no not yet but its only a matter of time the azkaban guards have never yet failed and they are angrier than ive ever seen them fudge shuddered slightly so ill say goodbye he held out his hand and harry shaking it had a sudden idea er minister can i ask you something certainly said fudge with a smile well third years at hogwarts are allowed to visit hogsmeade but my aunt and uncle didnt sign the permission form dyou think you could fudge was looking uncomfortable ah he said no no im very sorry harry but as im not your parent or guardian but youre the minister of magic said harry eagerly if you gave me permission no im sorry harry but rules are rules said fudge flatly perhaps youll be able to visit hogsmeade next year in fact i think its best if you dont yes well ill be off enjoy your stay harry and with a last smile and shake of harrys hand fudge left the room tom now moved forward beaming at harry if youll follow me mr potter he said ive already taken your things up harry followed tom up a handsome wooden staircase to a door with a brass number eleven on it which tom unlocked and opened for him inside was a very comfortablelooking bed some highly polished oak furniture a cheerfully crackling fire and perched on top of the wardrobe hedwig harry gasped the snowy owl clicked her beak and fluttered down onto harrys arm very smart owl youve got there chuckled tom arrived about five minutes after you did if theres anything you need mr potter dont hesitate to ask he gave another bow and left harry sat on his bed for a long time absentmindedly stroking hedwig the sky outside the window was changing rapidly from deep velvety blue to cold steely gray and then slowly to pink shot with gold harry could hardly believe that hed left privet drive only a few hours ago that he wasnt expelled and that he was now facing two completely dursleyfree weeks its been a very weird night hedwig he yawned and without even removing his glasses he slumped back onto his pillows and fell asleep chapter four the leaky cauldron it took harry several days to get used to his strange new freedom never before had he been able to get up whenever he wanted or eat whatever he fancied he could even go wherever he pleased as long as it was in diagon alley and as this long cobbled street was packed with the most fascinating wizarding shops in the world harry felt no desire to break his word to fudge and stray back into the muggle world harry ate breakfast each morning in the leaky cauldron where he liked watching the other guests funny little witches from the country up for a days shopping venerablelooking wizards arguing over the latest article in transfiguration today wildlooking warlocks raucous dwarfs and once what looked suspiciously like a hag who ordered a plate of raw liver from behind a thick woollen balaclava after breakfast harry would go out into the backyard take out his wand tap the third brick from the left above the trash bit and stand back as the archway into diagon alley opened in the wall harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the brightly colored umbrellas outside cafes where his fellow diners were showing one another their purchases its a lunascope old boy no more messing around with moon charts see or else discussing the case of sirius black personally i wont let any of the children out alone until hes back in azkaban harry didnt have to do his homework under the blankets by flashlight anymore now he could sit in the bright sunshine outside florean fortescues ice cream parlor finishing all his essays with occasional help from florean fortescue himself who apart from knowing a great deal about medieval witch burnings gave harry free sundaes every half an hour once harry had refilled his money bag with gold galleons silver sickles and bronze knuts from his vault at gringotts he had to exercise a lot of selfcontrol not to spend the whole lot at once he had to keep reminding himself that he had five years to go at hogwarts and how it would feel to ask the dursleys for money for spellbooks to stop himself from buying a handsome set of solid gold gobstones a wizarding game rather like marbles in which the stones squirt a nastysmelling liquid into the other players face when they lose a point he was sorely tempted too by the perfect moving model of the galaxy in a large glass ball which would have meant he never had to take another astronomy lesson but the thing that tested harrys resolution most appeared in his favorite shop quality quidditch supplies a week after hed arrived at the leaky cauldron curious to know what the crowd in the shop was staring at harry edged his way inside and squeezed in among the excited witches and wizards until he glimpsed a newly erected podium on which was mounted the most magnificent broom he had ever seen in his life just come out prototype a squarejawed wizard was telling his companion its the fastest broom in the world isnt it dad squeaked a boy younger than harry who was swinging off his fathers arm irish international sides just put in an order for seven of these beauties the proprietor of the shop told the crowd and theyre favorites for the world cup a large witch in front of harry moved and he was able to read the sign next to the broom the firebolt this stateoftheart pacing broom sports a streamlined superfine handle of ash treated with a diamondhard polish and hand numbered with its own registration number each individually selected birch twig in the broomtail has been honed to aerodynamic perfection giving the firebolt unsurpassable balance and pinpoint precision the firebolt has an acceleration of 150 miles an hour in ten seconds and incorporates an unbreakable braking charm price on request price on request harry didnt like to think how much gold the firebolt would cost he had never wanted anything as much in his whole life but he had never lost a quidditch match on his nim bus two thousand and what was the point in emptying his gringotts vault for the firebolt when he had a very good broom already harry didnt ask for the price but he returned almost every day after that just to look at the firebolt there were however things that harry needed to buy he went to the apothecary to replenish his store of potions ingredients and as his school robes were now several inches too short in the arm and leg he visited madam malkins robes for all occasions and bought new ones most important of all he had to buy his new schoolbooks which would include those for his two new subjects care of magical creatures and divination harry got a surprise as he looked in at the bookshop window instead of the usual display of gold embossed spellbooks the size of paving slabs there was a large iron cage behind the glass that held about a hundred copies of the monster book of monsters torn pages were flying everywhere as the books grappled with each other locked together in furious wrestling matches and snapping aggressively harry pulled his booklist out of his pocket and consulted it for the first time the monster book of monsters was listed as the required book for care of magical creatures now harry understood why hagrid had said it would come in useful he felt relieved he had been wondering whether hagrid wanted help with some terrifying new pet as harry entered flourish and blotts the manager came hurrying toward him hogwarts he said abruptly come to get your new books yes said harry i need get out of the way said the manager impatiently brushing harry aside he drew on a pair of very thick gloves picked up a large knobbly walking stick and proceeded toward the door of the monster books cage hang on said harry quickly ive already got one of those have you a look of enormous relief spread over the managers face thank heavens for that ive been bitten five times already this morning a loud ripping noise rent the air two of the monster books had seized a third and were pulling it apart stop it stop it cried the manager poking the walking stick through the bars and knocking the books apart im never stocking them again never its been bedlam i thought wed seen the worst when we bought two hundred copies of the invisible book of invisibility cost a fortune and we never found them well is there anything else i can help you with yes said harry looking down his booklist i need unfogging the future by cassandra vablatsky ah starting divination are you said the manager stripping off his gloves and leading harry into the back of the shop where there was a corner devoted to fortunetelling a small table was stacked with volumes such as predicting the unpredictable insulate yourself against shocks and broken balls when fortunes turn foul here you are said the manager who had climbed a set of steps to take down a thick black bound book unfogging the future very good guide to all your basic fortunetelling methods palmistry crystal balls bird entrails but harry wasnt listening his eyes had fallen on another book which was among a display on a small table death omens what to do when you know the worst is coming oh i wouldnt read that if i were you said the manager lightly looking to see what harry was staring at youll start seeing death omens everywhere its enough to frighten anyone to death but harry continued to stare at the front cover of the book it showed a black dog large as a bear with gleaming eyes it looked oddly familiar the manager pressed unfogging the future into harrys hands anything else he said yes said harry tearing his eyes away from the dogs and dazedly consulting his booklist er i need intermediate transfiguration and the standard book of spells grade three harry emerged from flourish and blotts ten minutes later with his new books under his arms and made his way back to the leaky cauldron hardly noticing where he was going and bumping into several people he tramped up the stairs to his room went inside and tipped his books onto his bed somebody had been in to tidy the windows were open and sun was pouring inside harry could hear the buses rolling by in the unseen muggle street behind him and the sound of the invisible crowd below in diagon alley he caught sight of himself in the mirror over the basin it cant have been a death omen he told his reflection defiantly i was panicking when i saw that thing in magnolia crescent it was probably just a stray dog he raised his hand automatically and tried to make his hair lie flat youre fighting a losing battle there dear said his mirror in a wheezy voice as the days slipped by harry started looking wherever he went for a sign of ron or hermione plenty of hogwarts students were arriving in diagon alley now with the start of term so near harry met seamus finnigan and dean thomas his fellow gryffindors in quality quidditch supplies where they too were ogling the firebolt he also ran into the real neville longbottom a roundfaced forgetful boy outside flourish and blotts harry didnt stop to chat neville appeared to have mislaid his booklist and was being told off by his very formidablelooking grandmother harry hoped she never found out that hed pretended to be neville while on the run from the ministry of magic harry woke on the last day of the holidays thinking that he would at least meet ron and hermione tomorrow on the hogwarts express he got up dressed went for a last look at the firebolt and was just wondering where hed have lunch when someone yelled his name and he turned harry harry they were there both of them sitting outside florean fortescues ice cream parlor ron looking incredibly freckly hermione very brown both waving frantically at him finally said ron grinning at harry as he sat down we went to the leaky cauldron but they said youd left and we went to flourish and blotts and madam malkins and i got all my school stuff last week harry explained and how come you knew im staying at the leaky cauldron dad said ron simply mr weasley who worked at the ministry of magic would of course have heard the whole story of what had happened to aunt marge did you really blow up your aunt harry said hermione in a very serious voice i didnt mean to said harry while ron roared with laughter i just lost control its not funny ron said hermione sharply honestly im amazed harry wasnt expelled so am i admitted harry forget expelled i thought i was going to be arrested he looked at ron your dad doesnt know why fudge let me off does he probably cause its you isnt it shrugged ron still chuckling famous harry potter and all that id hate to see what the ministryd do to me if i blew up an aunt mind you theyd have to dig me up first because mum wouldve killed me anyway you can ask dad yourself this evening were staying at the leaky cauldron tonight too so you can come to kings cross with us tomorrow hermiones there as well hermione nodded beaming mum and dad dropped me off this morning with all my hogwarts things excellent said harry happily so have you got all your new books and stuff look at this said ron pulling a long thin box out of a bag and opening it brandnew wand fourteen inches willow containing one unicorn tailhair and weve got all our books he pointed at a large bag under his chair what about those monster books eh the assistant nearly cried when we said we wanted two whats all that hermione harry asked pointing at not one but three bulging bags in the chair next to her well im taking more new subjects than you arent i said hermione those are my books for arithmancy care of magical creatures divination the study of ancient runes muggle studies what are you doing muggle studies for said ron rolling his eyes at harry youre muggle born your mum and dad are muggles you already know all about muggles but itll be fascinating to study them from the wizarding point of view said hermione earnestly are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year hermione asked harry while ron sniggered hermione ignored them ive still got ten galleons she said checking her purse its my birthday in september and mum and dad gave me some money to get myself an early birthday present how about a nice book said ron innocently no i dont think so said hermione composedly i really want an owl i mean harrys got hedwig and youve got errol i havent said ron errols a family owl all ive got is scabbers he pulled his pet rat out of his pocket and i want to get him checked over he added placing scabbers on the table in front of them i dont think egypt agreed with him scabbers was looking thinner than usual and there was a definite droop to his whiskers theres a magical creature shop just over there said harry who knew diagon alley very well by now you could see if theyve got anything for scabbers and hermione can get her owl so they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street to the magical menagerie there wasnt much room inside every inch of wall was hidden by cages it was smelly and very noisy because the occupants of these cages were all squeaking squawking jabbering or hissing the witch behind the counter was already advising a wizard on the care of doubleended newts so harry ron and hermione waited examining the cages a pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly and feasting on dead blowflies a gigantic tortoise with a jewelencrusted shell was glittering near the window poisonous orange snails were oozing slowly up the side of their glass tank and a fat white rabbit kept changing into a silk top hat and back again with a loud popping noise then there were cats of every color a noisy cage of ravens a basket of funny custardcolored furballs that were humming loudly and on the counter a vast cage of sleek black rats that were playing some sort of skipping game using their long bald tails the doubleended newt wizard left and ron approached the counter its my rat he told the witch hed been a bit offcolor ever since i brought him back from egypt bang him on the counter said the witch pulling a pair of heavy black spectacles out of her pocket ron lifted scabbers out of his inside pocket and placed him next to the cage of his fellow rats who stopped their skipping tricks and scuffled to the wire for a better look like nearly everything ron owned scabbers the rat was secondhand he had once belonged to rons brother percy and a bit battered next to the glossy rats in the cage he looked especially woebegone hmm said the witch picking up scabbers how old is this rat dunno said ron quite old he used to belong to my brother what powers does he have said the witch examining scabbers closely er the truth was that scabbers had never shown the faintest trace of interesting powers the witchs eyes moved from scabberss tattered left ear to his front paw which had a toe missing and tutted loudly hes been through the mill this one she said he was like that when percy gave him to me said ron defensively an ordinary common or garden rat like this cant be expected to live longer than three years or so said the witch now if you were looking for something a bit more hardwearing you might like one of these she indicated the black rats who promptly started skipping again ron muttered showoffs well if you dont want a replacement you can try this rat tonic said the witch reaching under the counter and bringing out a small red bottle okay said ron how much ouch ron buckled as something huge and orange came soaring from the top of the highest cage landed on his head and then propelled itself spitting madly at scabbers no crookshanks no cried the witch but scabbers shot from between her hands like a bar of soap landed splaylegged on the floor and then scampered for the door scabbers ron shouted racing out of the shop after him harry followed it took them nearly ten minutes to catch scabbers who had taken refuge under a wastepaper bin outside quality quidditch supplies ron stuffed the trembling rat back into his pocket and straightened up massaging his head what was that it was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger said harry wheres hermione probably getting her owl they made their way back up the crowded street to the magical menagerie as they reached it hermione came out but she wasnt carrying an owl her arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat you bought that monster said ron his mouth hanging open hes gorgeous isnt he said hermione glowing that was a matter of opinion thought harry the cats ginger fur was thick and fluffy but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy and oddly squashed as though it had run headlong into a brick wall now that scabbers was out of sight however the cat was purring contentedly in hermiones arms hermione that thing nearly scalped me said ron he didnt mean to did you crookshanks said hermione and what about scabbers said ron pointing at the lump in his chest pocket he needs rest and relaxation hows he going to get it with that thing around that reminds me you forgot your rat tonic said hermione slapping the small red bottle into rons hand and stop worrying crookshanks will be sleeping in my dormitory and scabbers in yours whats the problem poor crookshanks that witch said hed been in there for ages no one wanted him wonder why said ron sarcastically as they set off toward the leaky cauldron they found mr weasley sitting in the bar reading the daily prophet harry he said smiling as he looked up how are you fine thanks said harry as he ron and hermione joined mr weasley with all their shopping mr weasley put down his paper and harry saw the now familiar picture of sirius black staring up at him they still havent caught him then he asked no said mr weasley looking extremely grave theyve pulled us all off our regular jobs at the ministry to try and find him but no luck so far would we get a reward if we caught him asked ron itd be good to get some more money dont be ridiculous ron said mr weasley who on closer inspection looked very strained blacks not going to be caught by a thirteenyearold wizard its the azkaban guards wholl get him back you mark my words at that moment mrs weasley entered the bar laden with shopping bags and followed by the twins fred and george who were about to start their fifth year at hogwarts the newly elected head boy percy and the weasleys youngest child and only girl ginny ginny who had always been very taken with harry seemed even more heartily embarrassed than usual when she saw him perhaps because he had saved her life during their previous year at hogwarts she went very red and muttered hello without looking at him percy however held out his hand solemnly as though he and harry had never met and said harry how nice to see you hello percy said harry trying not to laugh i hope youre well said percy pompously shaking hands it was rather like being introduced to the mayor very well thanks harry said fred elbowing percy out of the way and bowing deeply simply splendid to see you old boy marvelous said george pushing fred aside and seizing harrys hand in turn absolutely spiffing percy scowled thats enough now said mrs weasley mum said fred as though hed only just spotted her and seizing her hand too how really corking to see you i said thats enough said mrs weasley depositing her shopping in an empty chair hello harry dear i suppose youve heard our exciting news she pointed to the brandnew silver badge on percys chest second head boy in the family she said swelling with pride and last fred muttered under his breath i dont doubt that said mrs weasley frowning suddenly i notice they havent made you two prefects what do we want to be prefects for said george looking revolted at the very idea itd take all the fun out of life ginny giggled you want to set a better example for your sister snapped mrs weasley ginnys got other brothers to set her an example mother said percy loftily im going up to change for dinner he disappeared and george heaved a sigh we tried to shut him in a pyramid he told harry but mum spotted us dinner that night was a very enjoyable affair tom the innkeeper put three tables together in the parlor and the seven weasleys harry and hermione ate their way through five delicious courses howre we getting to kings cross tomorrow dad asked fred as they dug into a sumptuous chocolate pudding the ministrys providing a couple of cars said mr weasley everyone looked up at him why said percy curiously its because of you perce said george seriously and therell be little flags on the hoods with hb on them for humongous bighead said fred everyone except percy and mrs weasley snorted into their pudding why are the ministry providing cars father percy asked again in a dignified voice well as we havent got one anymore said mr weasley and as i work there theyre doing me a favor his voice was casual but harry couldnt help noticing that mr weasleys ears had gone red just like rons did when he was under pressure good thing too said mrs weasley briskly do you realize how much luggage youve all got between you a nice sight youd be on the muggle underground you are all packed arent you ron hasnt put all his new things in his trunk yet said percy in a longsuffering voice hes dumped them on my bed youd better go and pack properly ron because we wont have much time in the morning mrs weasley called down the table ron scowled at percy after dinner everyone felt very full and sleepy one by one they made their way upstairs to their rooms to check their things for the next day ron and percy were next door to harry he had just closed and locked his own trunk when he heard angry voices through the wall and went to see what was going on the door of number twelve was ajar and percy was shouting it was here on the bedside table i took it off for polishing i havent touched it all right ron roared back whats up said harry my head boy badge is gone said percy rounding on harry sos scabberss rat tonic said ron throwing things out of his trunk to look i think i mightve left it in the bar youre not going anywhere till youve found my badge yelled percy ill get scabberss stuff im packed harry said to ron and he went downstairs harry was halfway along the passage to the bar which was now very dark when he heard another pair of angry voices coming from the parlor a second later he recognized them as mr and mrs weasleys he hesitated not wanting them to know hed heard them arguing when the sound of his own name made him stop then move closer to the parlor door makes no sense not to tell him mr weasley was saying heatedly harrys got a right to know ive tried to tell fudge but he insists on treating harry like a child hes thirteen years old and arthur the truth would terrify him said mrs weasley shrilly do you really want to send harry back to school with that hanging over him for heavens sake hes happy not knowing i dont want to make him miserable i want to put him on his guard retorted mr weasley you know what harry and ron are like wandering off by themselves theyve ended up in the forbidden forest twice but harry mustnt do that this year when i think what could have happened to him that night he ran away from home if the knight bus hadnt picked him up im prepared to bet he would have been dead before the ministry found him but hes not dead hes fine so whats the point molly they say sirius blacks mad and maybe he is but he was clever enough to escape from azkaban and thats supposed to be impossible its been three weeks and no ones seen hide nor hear of him and i dont care what fudge keeps telling the daily prophet were no nearer catching black than inventing selfspelling wands the only thing we know for sure is what blacks after but harry will be perfectly safe at hogwarts we thought azkaban was perfectly safe if black can break out of azkaban he can break into hogwarts but no ones really sure that blacks after harry there was a thud on wood and harry was sure mr weasley had banged his fist on the table molly how many times do i have to tell you they didnt report it in the press because fudge wanted it kept quiet but fudge went out to azkaban the night black escaped the guards told fudge that blacks been talking in his sleep for a while now always the same words hes at hogwarts hes at hogwarts black is deranged molly and he wants harry dead if you ask me he thinks murdering harry will bring youknowwho back to power black lost everything the night harry stopped you knowwho and hes had twelve years alone in azkaban to brood on that there was a silence harry leaned still closer to the door desperate to hear more well arthur you must do what you think is right but youre forgetting albus dumbledore i dont think anything could hurt harry at hogwarts while dumbledores headmaster i suppose he knows about all this of course he knows we had to ask him if he minds the azkaban guards stationing themselves around the entrances to the school grounds he wasnt happy about it but he agreed not happy why shouldnt he be happy if theyre there to catch black dumbledore isnt fond of the azkaban guards said mr weasley heavily nor am i if it comes to that but when youre dealing with a wizard like black you sometimes have to join forces with those youd rather avoid if they save harry then i will never say another word against them said mr weasley wearily its late molly wed better go up harry heard chairs move as quietly as he could he hurried down the passage to the bar and out of sight the parlor door opened and a few seconds later footsteps told him that mr and mrs weasley were climbing the stairs the bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they had sat at earlier harry waited until he heard mr and mrs weasleys bedroom door close then headed back upstairs with the bottle fred and george were crouching in the shadows on the landing heaving with laughter as they listened to percy dismantling his and rons room in search of his badge weve got it fred whispered to harry weve been improving it the badge now read bighead boy harry forced a laugh went to give ron the rat tonic then shut himself in his room and lay down on his bed so sirius black was after him this explained everything fudge had been lenient with him because he was so relieved to find him alive hed made harry promise to stay in diagon alley where there were plenty of wizards to keep an eye on him and he was sending two ministry cars to take them all to the station tomorrow so that the weasleys could look after harry until he was on the train harry lay listening to the muffled shouting next door and wondered why he didnt feel more scared sirius black had murdered thirteen people with one curse mr and mrs weasley obviously thought harry would be panicstricken if he knew the truth but harry happened to agree wholeheartedly with mrs weasley that the safest place on earth was wherever albus dumbledore happened to be didnt people always say that dumbledore was the only person lord voldemort had ever been afraid of surely black as voldemorts righthand man would be just as frightened of him and then there were these azkaban guards everyone kept talking about they seemed to scare most people senseless and if they were stationed all around the school blacks chances of getting inside seemed very remote now all in all the thing that bothered harry most was the fact that his chances of visiting hogsmeade now looked like zero nobody would want harry to leave the safety of the castle until black was caught in fact harry suspected his every move would be carefully watched until the danger had passed he scowled at the dark ceiling did they think he couldnt look after himself hed escaped lord voldemort three times he wasnt completely useless unbidden the image of the beast in the shadows of magnolia crescent crossed his mind what to do when you know the worst is coming im not going to be murdered harry said out loud thats the spirit dear said his mirror sleepily chapter five the dementor tom woke harry the next morning with his usual toothless grin and a cup of tea harry got dressed and was just persuading a disgruntled hedwig to get back into her cage when ron banged his way into the room pulling a sweatshirt over his head and looking irritable the sooner we get on the train the better he said at least i can get away from percy at hogwarts now hes accusing me of dripping tea on his photo of penelope clearwater you know ron grimaced his girlfriend shes hidden her face under the frame because her nose has gone all blotchy ive got something to tell you harry began but they were interrupted by fred and george who had looked in to congratulate ron on infuriating percy again they headed down to breakfast where mr weasley was reading the front page of the daily prophet with a furrowed brow and mrs weasley was telling hermione and ginny about a love potion shed made as a young girl all three of them were rather giggly what were you saying ron asked harry as they sat down later harry muttered as percy stormed in harry had no chance to speak to ron or hermione in the chaos of leaving they were too busy heaving all their trunks down the leaky cauldrons narrow staircase and piling them up near the door with hedwig and hermes percys screech owl perched on top in their cages a small wickerwork basket stood beside the heap of trunks spitting loudly its all right crookshanks hermione cooed through the wickerwork ill let you out on the train you wont snapped ron what about poor scabbers eh he pointed at his chest where a large lump indicated that scabbers was curled up in his pocket mr weasley who had been outside waiting for the ministry cars stuck his head inside theyre here he said harry come on mr weasley marched harry across the short stretch of pavement toward the first of two oldfashioned dark green cars each of which was driven by a furtivelooking wizard wearing a suit of emerald velvet in you get harry said mr weasley glancing up and down the crowded street harry got into the back of the car and was shortly joined by hermione ron and to rons disgust percy the journey to kings cross was very uneventful compared with harrys trip on the knight bus the ministry of magic cars seemed almost ordinary though harry noticed that they could slide through gaps that uncle vernons new company car certainly couldnt have managed they reached kings cross with twenty minutes to spare the ministry drivers round their trolleys unloaded their trunks touched their hats in salute to mr weasley and drove away somehow managing to jump to the head of an unmoving line at the traffic lights mr weasley kept close to harrys elbow all the way into the station right then he said glancing around them lets do this in pairs as there are so many of us ill go through first with harry mr weasley strolled toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten pushing harrys trolley and apparently very interested in the intercity 125 that had just arrived at platform nine with a meaningful look at harry he leaned casually against the barrier harry imitated him in a moment they had fallen sideways through the solid metal onto platform nine and three quarters and looked up to see the hogwarts express a scarlet steam engine puffing smoke over a platform packed with witches and wizards seeing their children onto the train percy and ginny suddenly appeared behind harry they were panting and had apparently taken the barrier at a run ah theres penelope said percy smoothing his hair and going pink again ginny caught harrys eye and they both turned away to hide their laughter as percy strode over to a girl with long curly hair walking with his chest thrown out so that she couldnt miss his shiny badge once the remaining weasleys and hermione had joined them harry and ron led the way to the end of the train past packed compartments to a carriage that looked quite empty they loaded the trunks onto it stowed hedwig and crookshanks in the luggage rack then went back outside to say goodbye to mr and mrs weasley mrs weasley kissed all her children then hermione and finally harry he was embarrassed but really quite pleased when she gave him an extra hug do take care wont you harry she said as she straightened up her eyes oddly bright then she opened her enormous handbag and said ive made you all sandwiches here you are ron no theyre not corned beef fred wheres fred here you are dear harry said mr weasley quietly come over here a moment he jerked his head towards a pillar and harry followed him behind it leaving the others crowded around mrs weasley theres something ive got to tell you before you leave said mr weasley in a tense voice its all right mr weasley said harry i already know you know how could you know i er i heard you and mrs weasley talking last night i couldnt help hearing harry added quickly sorry thats not the way id have chosen for you to find outsaid mr weasley looking anxious no honestly its okay this way you havent broken your word to fudge and i know whats going on harry you must be very scared im not said harry sincerely really he added because mr weasley was looking disbelieving im not trying to be a hero but seriously sirius black cant be worse than voldemort can he mr weasley flinched at the sound of the name but overlooked it harry i knew you were well made of stronger stuff than fudge seems to think and im obviously pleased that youre not scared but arthur called mrs weasley who was not shepherding the rest onto the train arthur what are you doing its about to go hes coming molly said mr weasley but he turned back to harry and kept talking in a lower and more hurried voice listen i want you to give me your word that ill be a good boy and stay in the castle said harry gloomily not entirely said mr weasley who looked more serious than harry had ever seen him harry swear to me that you wont go looking for black harry stared what there was a loud whistle guards were walking along the train slamming all the doors shut promise me harry said mr weasley talking more quickly still that whatever happens why would i go looking for someone i know wants to kill me said harry blankly swear to me that whatever you might hear arthur quickly cried mrs weasley steam was billowing from the train it had started to move harry ran to the compartment door and ron threw it open and stood back to let him on they leaned out of the window and waved at mr and mrs weasley until the train turned a corner and blocked them from view i need to talk to you in private harry muttered to ron and hermione as the train picked up speed go away ginny said ron oh thats nice said ginny huffily and she stalked off harry ron and hermione set off down the corridor looking for an empty compartment but all were full except for the one at the very end of the train this had only one occupant a man sitting fast asleep next to the window harry ron and hermione checked on the threshold the hogwarts express was usually reserved for students and they had never seen an adult there before except for the witch who pushed the food cart the stranger was wearing an extremely shabby set of wizards robes that had been darned in several places he looked ill and exhausted though quite young his light brown hair was flecked with gray who dyou reckon he is ron hissed as they sat down and slid the door shut taking the seats farthest away from the window professor r j lupin whispered hermione at once how dyou know that its on his case she replied pointing at the luggage rack over the mans head where there was a small battered case held together with a large quantity of neatly knotted string the name professor r j lupin was stamped across one corner in peeling letters wonder what he teaches said ron frowning at professor lupins pallid profile thats obvious whispered hermione theres only one vacancy isnt there defense against the dark arts harry ron and hermione had already had two defense against the dark arts teachers both of whom had lasted only one year there were rumors that the job was jinxed well i hope hes up to it said ron doubtfully he looks like one good hex would finish him off doesnt he anyway he turned to harry what were you going to tell us harry explained all about mr and mrs weasleys argument and the warning mr weasley had just given him when hed finished ron looked thunderstruck and hermione had her hands over her mouth she finally lowered them to say sirius black escaped to come after you oh harry youll have to be really really careful dont go looking for trouble harry i dont go looking for trouble said harry nettled trouble usually finds me how thick would harry have to be to go looking for a nutter who wants to kill him said ron shakily they were taking the news worse than harry had expected both ron and hermione seemed to be much more frightened of black than he was no one knows how he got out of azkaban said ron uncomfortably no ones ever done it before and he was a topsecurity prisoner too but theyll catch him wont they said hermione earnestly i mean theyve got all the muggles looking out for him too whats that noise said ron suddenly a faint tinny sort of whistle was coming from somewhere they looked all around the compartment its coming from your trunk harry said ron standing up and reaching into the luggage rack a moment later he had pulled the pocket sneakoscope out from between harrys robes it was spinning very fast in the palm of rons hand and glowing brilliantly is that a sneakoscope said hermione interestedly standing up for a better look yeah mind you its a very cheap one ron said it went haywire just as i was tying it to errols leg to send it to harry were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time said hermione shrewdly no well i wasnt supposed to be using errol you know hes not really up to long journeys but how else was i supposed to get harrys present to him stick it back in the trunk harry advised as the sneakoscope whistled piercingly or itll wake him up he nodded toward professor lupin ron stuffed the sneakoscope into a particularly horrible pair of uncle vernons old socks which deadened the sound then closed the lid of the trunk on it we could get it checked in hogsmeade said ron sitting back down they sell that sort of thing in dervish and banges magical instruments and stuff fred and george told me do you know much about hogsmeade asked hermione keenly ive read its the only entirely nonmuggle settlement in britain yeah i think it is said ron in an offhand sort of way but thats not why i want to go i just want to get inside honey dukes whats that said hermione its this sweetshop said ron a dreamy look coming over his face where theyve got everything pepper imps they make you smoke at the mouth and great fat chocoballs full of strawberry mousse and clotted cream and really excellent sugar quills which you can suck in class and just look like youre thinking what to write next but hogsmeades a very interesting place isnt it hermione pressed on eagerly in sites of historical sorcery it says the inn was the headquarters for the 1612 goblin rebellion and the shrieking shacks supposed to be the most severely haunted building in britain and massive sherbert balls that make you levitate a few inches off the ground while youre sucking them said ron who was plainly not listening to a word hermione was saying hermione looked around at harry wont it be nice to get out of school for a bit and explore hogsmeade spect it will said harry heavily youll have to tell me when youve found out what dyou mean said ron i cant go the dursleys didnt sign my permission form and fudge wouldnt either ron looked horrified youre not allowed to come but no way mcgonagall or someone will give you permission harry gave a hollow laugh professor mcgonagall head of gryffindor house was very strict or we can ask fred and george they know every secret passage out of the castle ron said hermione sharply i dont think harry should be sneaking out of school with black on the loose yeah i expect thats what mcgonagall will say when i ask for permission said harry bitterly but if were with him said ron spiritedly to hermione black wouldnt dare oh ron dont talk rubbish snapped hermione blacks already murdered a whole bunch of people in the middle of a crowded street do you really think hes going to worry about attacking harry just because were there she was fumbling with the straps of crookshanks basket as she spoke dont let that thing out ron said but too late crookshanks leapt lightly from the basket stretched yawned and sprang onto rons knees the lump in rons pocket trembled and he shoved crookshanks angrily away get out of here ron dont said hermione angrily ron was about to answer back when professor lupin stirred they watched him aprehensively but he simply turned his head the other way mouth slightly open and slept on the hogwarts express moved steadily north and the scenery outside the window became wilder and darker while the clouds overhead thickened people were chasing backward and forward past the door of their compartment crookshanks had now settled in an empty seat his squashed face turned towards ron his yellow eyes on rons top pocket at one oclock the plump witch with the food cart arrived at the compartment door dyou think we should wake him up ron asked awkwardly nodding toward professor lupin he looks like he could do with some food hermione approached professor lupin cautiously er professor she said excuse me professor he didnt move dont worry dear said the witch as she handed harry a large stack of cauldron cakes if hes hungry when he wakes ill be up front with the driver i suppose he is asleep said ron quietly as the witch slid the compartment door closed i mean he hasnt died has he no no hes breathing whispered hermione taking the cauldron cake harry passed her he might not be very good company but professor lupins presence in their compartment had its uses midafternoon just as it had started to rain blurring the rolling hills outside the window they heard footsteps in the corridor again and their three least favorite people appeared at the door draco malfoy flanked by his cronies vincent crabbe and gregory goyle draco malfoy and harry had been enemies ever since they had met on their very first train journey to hogwarts malfoy who had a pale pointed sneering face was in slytherin house he played seeker on the slytherin quidditch team the same postiion that harry played on the griffindor team crabbe and goyle seemed to exist to do malfoys bidding they were both wide and musclely crabbe was taller with a puddingbowl haircut and a very thick neck goyle had short bristly hair and long gorillaish arms well look who it is said malfoy in his usual lazy drawl pulling open the compartment door potty and the weasel crabbe and goyle chuckled trollishly i heard your father finally got his hands on some gold this summer weasley said malfoy did your mother die of shock ron stood up so quickly he knocked crookshankss basket to the floor professor lupin gave a snort whos that said malfoy taking an automatic step backward as he spotted lupin new teacher said harry who got to his feet too in case he needed to hold ron back what were you saying malfoy malfoys pale eyes narrowed he wasnt fool enough to pick a fight right under a teachers nose cmon he muttered resentfully to crabbe and goyle and they disappeared harry and ron sat down again ron massaging his knuckles im not going to take any crap from malfoy this year he said angrily i mean it if he makes one more crack about my family im going to get hold of his head and ron made a violent gesture in midair ron hissed hermione pointing at professor lupin be careful but professor lupin was still fast asleep the rain thickened as the train sped yet farther north the windows were now a solid shimmering gray which gradually darkened until lanterns flickered into life all along the corridors and over the luggage racks the train rattled the rain hammered and roared but still professor lupin slept we must be nearly there said ron leaning forward to look past professor lupin at the now completely black window the words had hardly left him when the train started to slow down great said ron getting up and walking carefully past professor lupin to try and see outside im starving i want to get to the feast we cant be there yet said hermione checking her watch so whyre we stopping the train was getting slower and slower as the noise of the pistons fell away the wind and rain sounded louder than ever against the windows harry who was nearest the door got up to look into the corridor all along the carriage heads were sticking curiously out of their compartments the train came to a stop with a jolt and distant thuds and bangs told them that luggage had fallen out of the racks then without warning all the lamps went out and they were plunged into total darkness whats going on said rons voice from behind harry ouch gasped hermione ron that was my foot harry felt his way back to his seat dyou think weve broken down dunno there was a squeaking sound and harry saw the dim black outline of ron wiping a patch clean on the window and peering out theres something moving out there ron said i think people are coming aboard the compartment door suddenly opened and someone fell painfully over harrys legs sorry dyou know whats going on ouch sorry hello neville said harry feeling around in the dark and pulling neville up by his cloak harry is that you whats happening no idea sit down there was a loud hissing and a yelp of pain neville had tried to sit on crookshanks im going to go and ask the driver whats going on came hermiones voice harry felt her pass him heard the door slide open again and then a thud and two loud squeals of pain whos that whos that ginny hermione what are you doing i was looking for ron come in and sit down not here said harry hurriedly im here ouch said neville quiet said a hoarse voice suddenly professor lupin appeared to have woken up at last harry could hear movements in his corner none of them spoke there was a soft crackling noise and a shivering light filled the compartment professor lupin appeared to be holding a handful of flames they illuminated his tired gray face but his eyes looked alert and wary stay where you are he said in the same hoarse voice and he got slowly to his feet with his handful of fire held out in front of him but the door slid slowly open before lupin could reach it standing in the doorway illuminated by the shivering flames in lupins hand was a cloaked figure that towered to the ceiling its face was completely hidden beneath its hood harrys eyes darted downward and what he saw made his stomach contract there was a hand protruding from the cloak and it was glistening grayish slimylooking and scabbed like something dead that had decayed in water but it was visible only for a split second as though the creature beneath the cloak sensed harrys gaze the hand was suddenly withdrawn into the folds of its black cloak and then the thing beneath the hood whatever it was drew a long slow rattling breath as though it were trying to suck something more than air from its surroundings an intense cold swept over them all harry felt his own breath catch in his chest the cold went deeper than his skin it was inside his chest it was inside his very heart harrys eyes rolled up into his head he couldnt see he was drowning in cold there was a rushing in his ears as though of water he was being dragged downward the roaring growing louder and then from far away he heard screaming terrible terrified pleading screams he wanted to help whoever it was he tried to move his arms but couldnt a thick white fog was swirling around him inside him harry harry are you all right someone was slapping his face w what harry opened his eyes there were lanterns above him and the floor was shaking the hogwarts express was moving again and the lights had come back on he seemed to have slid out of his seat onto the floor ron and hermione were kneeling next to him and above them he could see neville and professor lupin watching harry felt very sick when he put up and push his glasses back on he felt cold sweat on his face ron and hermione heaved him back onto his seat are you okay ron asked nervously yeah said harry looking quickly toward the door the hooded creature had vanished what happened wheres that that thing who screamed no one screamed said ron more nervously still harry looked around the bright compartment ginny and neville looked back at him both very pale but i heard screaming a loud snap made them all jump professor lupin was breaking an enormous slab of chocolate into pieces here he said to harry handing him a particularly large piece eat it itll help harry took the chocolate but didnt eat it what was that thing he asked lupin a dementor said lupin who was now giving chocolate to everyone else one of the dementors of azkaban everyone stared at him professor lupin crumpled up the empty chocolate wrapper and put it in his pocket eat he repeated itll help i need to speak to the driver excuse me he strolled past harry and disappeared into the corridor are you sure youre okay harry said hermione watching harry anxiously i dont get it what happened said harry wiping more sweat off his face well that thing the dementor stood there and looked around i mean i think it did i couldnt see its face and you you i thought you were having a fit or something said ron who still looked scared you went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat and started twitching and professor lupin stepped over you and walked toward the dementor and pulled out his wand said hermione and he said none of us is hiding sirius black under our cloaks go but the dementor didnt move so lupin muttered something and a silvery thing shot out of his wand at it and it turned around and sort of glided away it was horrible said neville in a higher voice than usual did you feel how cold it got when it came in i felt weird said ron shifting his shoulders uncomfortably like id never be cheerful again ginny who was huddled in her corner looking nearly as bad as harry felt gave a small sob hermione went over and put a comforting arm around her but didnt any of you fall off your seats said harry awkwardly no said ron looking anxiously at harry again ginny was shaking like mad though harry didnt understand he felt weak and shivery as though he were recovering from a bad bout of flu he also felt the beginnings of shame why had he gone to pieces like that when no one else had professor lupin had come back he paused as he entered looked around and said with a small smile i havent poisoned that chocolate you know harry took a bite and to his great surprise felt warmth spread suddenly to the tips of his fingers and toes well be at hogwarts in ten minutes said professor lupin are you all right harry harry didnt ask how professor lupin knew his name fine he muttered embarrassed they didnt talk much during the remainder of the journey at long last the train stopped at hogsmeade station and there was a great scramble to get outside owls hooted cats meowed and nevilles pet toad croaked loudly from under his hat it was freezing on the tiny platform rain was driving down in icy sheets firs years this way called a familiar voice harry ron and hermione turned and saw the gigantic outline of hagrid at the other end of the platform beckoning the terrifiedlooking new students forward for their traditional journey across the lake all right you three hagrid yelled over the heads of the crowd they waved at him but had no chance to speak to him because the mass of people around them was shunting them away along the platform harry ron and hermione followed the rest of the school along the platform and out onto a rough mud track where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited the remaining students each pulled harry could only assume by an invisible horse because when they climbed inside and shut the door the coach set off all by itself bumping and swaying in procession the coach smelled faintly of mold and straw harry felt better since the chocolate but still weak ron and hermione kept looking at him sideways as though frightened he might collapse again as the carriage trundled toward a pair of magnificent wrought iron gates flanked with stone columns topped with winged boars harry saw two more towering hooded dementors standing guard on either side a wave of cold sickness threatened to engulf him again he leaned back into the lumpy seat and closed his eyes until they had passed the gates the carriage picked up speed on the long sloping drive up to the castle hermione was leaning out of the tiny window watching the many turrets and towers draw nearer at last the carriage swayed to a halt and hermione and ron got out as harry stepped down a drawling delighted voice sounded in his ear you fainted potter is longbottorn telling the truth you actually fainted malfoy elbowed past hermione to block harrys way up the stone steps to the castle his face gleeful and his pale eyes glinting maliciously shove off malfoy said ron whose jaw was clenched did you faint as well weasley said malfoy loudly did the scary old dementor frighten you too weasley is there a problem said a mild voice professor lupin had just gotten out of the next carriage malfoy gave professor lupin an insolent stare which took in the patches on his robes and the delapidated suitcase with a tiny hint of sarcasm in his voice he said oh no er professor then he smirked at crabbe and goyle and led them up the steps into the castle hermione prodded ron in the back to make him hurry and the three of them joined the crowd swarming up the steps through the giant oak front doors into the cavernous entrance hall which was lit with flaming torches and housed a magnificent marble staircase that led to the upper floors the door into the great hall stood open at the right harry followed the crowd toward it but had barely glimpsed the enchanted ceiling which was black and cloudy tonight when a voice called potter granger i want to see you both harry and hermione turned around surprised professor mcgonagall transfiguration teacher and head of gryffindor house was calling over the heads of the crowd she was a sternlooking witch who wore her hair in a tight bun her sharp eyes were framed with square spectacles harry fought his way over to her with a feeling of foreboding professor mcgonagall had a way of making him feel he must have done something wrong theres no need to look so worried i just want a word in my office she told them move along there weasley ron stared as professor mcgonagall ushered harry and hermione away from the chattering crowd they accompanied her across the entrance hall up the marble staircase and along a corridor once they were in her office a small room with a large welcoming fire professor mcgonagall motioned harry and hermione to sit down she settled herself behind her desk and said abruptly professor lupin sent an owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on the train potter before harry could reply there was a soft knock on the door and madam pomfrey the nurse came bustling in harry felt himself going red in the face it was bad enough that hed passed out or whatever he had done without everyone making all this fuss im fine he said i dont need anything oh its you is it said madam pomfrey ignoring this and bending down to stare closely at him i suppose youve been doing something dangerous again it was a dementor poppy said professor mcgonagall they exchanged a dark look and madam pomfrey clucked disapprovingly setting dementors around a school she muttered pushing back harrys hair and feeling his forehead he wont be the last one who collapses yes hes all clammy terrible things they are and the effect they have on people who are already delicate im not delicate said harry crossly of course youre not said madam pomfrey absentmindedly now taking his pulse what does he need said professor mcgonagall crisply bed rest should he perhaps spend tonight in the hospital wing im fine said harry jumping up the thought of what draco malfoy would say if he had to go to the hospital wing was torture well he should have some chocolate at the very least said madam pomfrey who was now trying to peer into harrys eyes ive already had some said harry professor lupin gave me some he gave it to all of us did he now said madam pomfrey approvingly so weve finally got a defense against the dark arts teacher who knows his remedies are you sure you feel all right potter professor mcgonagall said sharply yes said harry very well kindly wait outside while i have a quick word with miss granger about her course schedule then we can go down to the feast together harry went back into the corridor with madam pomfrey who left for the hospital wing muttering to herself he had to wait only a few minutes then hermione emerged looking very happy about something followed by professor mcgonagall and the three of them made their way back down the marble staircase to the great hall it was a sea of pointed black hats each of the long house tables was lined with students their faces glimmering by the light of thousands of candles which were floating over the tables in midair professor flitwick who was a tiny little wizard with a shock of white hair was carrying an ancient hat and a threelegged stool out of the hall oh said hermione softly weve missed the sorting new students at hogwarts were sorted into houses by trying on the sorting hat which shouted out the house they were best suited to gryffindor ravenclaw hufflepuff or slytherin professor mcgonagall strode off toward her empty seat at the staff table and harry and hermione set off in the other direction as quietly as possible toward the gryffindor table people looked around at them as they passed along the back of the hall and a few of them pointed at harry had the story of his collapsing in front of the dementor traveled that fast he and hermione sat down on either side of ron who had saved them seats what was all that about he muttered to harry harry started to explain in a whisper but at that moment the headmaster stood up to speak and he broke off professor dumbledore though very old always gave an impression of great energy he had several feet of long silver hair and beard halfmoon spectacles and an extremely crooked nose he was often described as the greatest wizard of the age but that wasnt why harry respected him you couldnt help trusting albus dumbledore and as harry watched him beaming around at the students he felt really calm for the first time since the dementor had entered the train compartment welcome said dumbledore the candlelight shimmering on his beard welcome to another year at hogwarts i have a few things to say to you all and as one of them is very serious i think it best to get it out of the way before you become befuddled by our excellent feast dumbledore cleared his throat and continued as you will all be aware after their search of the hogwarts express our school is presently playing host to some of the dementors of azkaban who are here on ministry of magic business he paused and harry remembered what mr weasley had said about dumbledore not being happy with the dementors guarding the school they are stationed at every entrance to the grounds dumbledore continued and while they are with us i must make it plain that nobody is to leave school without permission dementors are not to be fooled by tricks or disguises or even invisibility cloaks he added blandly and harry and ron glanced at each other it is not in the nature of a dementor to understand pleading or excuses i therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you i look to the prefects and our new head boy and girl to make sure that no student runs afoul of the dementors he said percy who was sitting a few seats down from harry puffed out his chest again and stared around impressively dumbledore paused again he looked very seriously around the hall and nobody moved or made a sound on a happier note he continued i am pleased to welcome two new teachers to our ranks this year first professor lupin who has kindly consented to fill the post of defense against the dark arts teacher there was some scattered rather unenthusiastic applause only those who had been in the compartment on the train with professor lupin clapped hard harry among them professor lupin looked particularly shabby next to all the other teachers in their best robes look at snape ron hissed in harrys ear professor snape the potions master was staring along the staff table at professor lupin it was common knowledge that snape wanted the defense against the dark arts job but even harry who hated snape was startled at the expression twisting his thin sallow face it was beyond anger it was loathing harry knew that expression only too well it was the look snape wore every time he set eyes on harry as to our second new appointment dumbledore continued as the lukewarm applause for professor lupin died away well i am sorry to tell you that professor kettleburn our care of magical creatures teacher retired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs however i am delighted to say that his place will be filled by none other than rubeus hagrid who has agreed to take on this teaching job in addition to his gamekeeping duties harry ron and hermione stared at one another stunned then they joined in with the applause which was tumultuous at the gryffindor table in particular harry leaned forward to see hagrid who was rubyred in the face and staring down at his enormous hands his wide grin hidden in the tangle of his black beard we shouldve known ron roared pounding the table who else would have assigned us a biting book harry ron and hermione were the last to stop clapping and as professor dumbledore started speaking again they saw that hagrid was wiping his eyes on the tablecloth well i think thats everything of importance said dumbledore let the feast begin the golden plates and goblets before them filled suddenly with food and drink harry suddenly ravenous helped himself to everything he could reach and began to eat it was a delicious feast the hall echoed with talk laughter and the clatter of knives and forks harry ron and hermione however were eager for it to finish so that they could talk to hagrid they knew how much being made a teacher would mean to him hagrid wasnt a fully qualified wizard he had been expelled from hogwarts in his third year for a crime he had not committed it had been harry ron and hermione who had cleared hagrids name last year at long last when the last morsels of pumpkin tart had melted from the golden platters dumbledore gave the word that it was time for them all to go to bed and they got their chance congratulations hagrid hermione squealed as they reached the teachers table all down ter you three said hagrid wiping his shining face on his napkin as he looked up at them can believe it great man dumbledore came straight down to me hut after professor kettleburn said hed had enough its what i always wanted overcome with emotion he buried his face in his napkin and professor mcgonagall shooed them away harry ron and hermione joined the gryffindors streaming up the marble staircase and very tired now along more corridors up more and more stairs to the hidden entrance to gryffindor towers large portrait of a fat lady in a pink dress asked them password coming through coming through percy called from behind the crowd the new passwords fortuna major oh no said neville longbottom sadly he always had trouble remembering the passwords through the portrait hole and across the common room the girls and boys divided toward their separate staircases harry climbed the spiral stair with no thought in his head except how glad he was to be back they reached their familiar circular dormitory with its five fourposter beds and harry looking around felt he was home at last chapter six talons and tea leaves when harry ron and hermione entered the great hall for breakfast the next day the first thing they saw was draco malfoy who seemed to be entertaining a large group of slytherins with a very funny story as they passed malfoy did a ridiculous impression of a swooning fit and there was a roar of laughter ignore him said hermione who was right behind harry just ignore him its not worth it hey potter shrieked pansy parkinson a slytherin girl with a face like a pug potter the dementors are coming potter woooooooooo harry dropped into a seat at the gryffindor table next to george weasley new thirdyear course schedules said george passing them over whats up with you harry malfoy said ron sitting down on georges other side and glaring over at the slytherin table george looked up in time to see malfoy pretending to faint with terror again that little git he said calmly he wasnt so cocky last night when the dementors were down at our end of the train came running into our compartment didnt he fred nearly wet himself said fred with a contemptuous glance at malfoy i wasnt too happy myself said george theyre horrible things those dementors sort of freeze your insides dont they said fred you didnt pass out though did you said harry in a low voice forget it harry said george bracingly dad had to go out to azkaban one time remember fred and he said it was the worst place hed ever been he came back all weak and shaking they suck the happiness out of a place dementors most of the prisoners go mad in there anyway well see how happy malfoy looks after our first quidditch match said fred gryffindor versus slytherin first game of the season remember the only time harry and malfoy had faced each other in a quidditch match malfoy had definitely come off worse feeling slightly more cheerful harry helped himself to sausages and fried tomatoes hermione was examining her new schedule ooh good were starting some new subjects today she said happily villains are these that trespass upon my private lands come i scorn at my fall perchance draw you knaves you dogs they watched in astonishment as the little knight tugged his sword out of its scabbard and began brandishing it violently hopping up and down in rage but the sword was too long for him a particularly wild swing made him overbalance and he landed facedown in the grass are you all right said harry moving closer to the picture get back you scurvy braggart back you rogue the knight seized his sword again and used it to push himself back up but the blade sank deeply into the grass and though he pulled with all his might he couldnt get it out again finally he had to flop back down onto the grass and push up his visor to mop his sweating face listen said harry taking advantage of the knights exhaustion were looking for the north tower you dont know the way do you a quest the knights rage seemed to vanish instantly he clanked to his feet and shouted come follow me dear friends and we shall find our goal or else shall perish bravely in the charge he gave the sword another fruitless tug tried and failed to mount the fat pony gave up and cried on foot then good sirs and gentle lady on on and he ran clanking loudly into the left side of the frame and out of sight they hurried after him along the corridor following the sound of his armor every now and then they spotted him running through a picture ahead be of stout heart the worst is yet to come yelled the knight and they saw him reappear in front of an alarmed group of women in crinolines whose picture hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircase puffing loudly harry ron and hermione climbed the tightly spiraling steps getting dizzier and dizzier until at last they heard the murmur of voices above them and knew they had reached the classroom farewell cried the knight popping his head into a painting of some sinisterlooking monks farewell my comradesinarms if ever you have need of noble heart and steely sinew call upon sir cadogan yeah well call you muttered ron as the knight disappeared if we ever need someone mental they climbed the last few steps and emerged onto a tiny landing where most of the class was already assembled there were no doors off this landing but ron nudged harry and pointed at the ceiling where there was a circular trapdoor with a brass plaque on it sibyll trelawney divination teacher harry read howre we supposed to get up there as though in answer to his question the trapdoor suddenly opened and a silvery ladder descended right at harrys feet everyone got quiet after you said ron grinning so harry climbed the ladder first he emerged into the strangestlooking classroom he had ever seen in fact it didnt look like a classroom at all more like a cross between someones attic and an oldfashioned tea shop at least twenty small circular tables were crammed inside it all surrounded by chintz armchairs and fat little poufs everything was lit with a dim crimson light the curtains at the windows were all closed and the many lamps were draped with dark red scarves it was stiflingly warm and the fire that was burning under the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a heavy sickly sort of perfume as it heated a large copper kettle the shelves running around the circular walls were crammed with dustylooking feathers stubs of candles many packs of tattered playing cards countless silvery crystal balls and a huge array of teacups ron appeared at harrys shoulder as the class assembled around them all talking in whispers where is she ron said a voice came suddenly out of the shadows a soft misty sort of voice welcome it said how nice to see you in the physical world at last harrys immediate impression was of a large glittering insect professor trelawney moved into the firelight and they saw that she was very thin her large glasses magnified her eyes to several times their natural size and she was draped in a gauzy spangled shawl innumerable chains and beads hung around her spindly neck and her arms and hands were encrusted with bangles and rings sit my children sit she said and they all climbed awkwardly into armchairs or sank onto poufs harry ron and hermione sat themselves around the same round table welcome to divination said professor trelawney who had seated herself in a winged armchair in front of the fire my name is professor trelawney you may not have seen me before i find that descending too often into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my inner eye nobody said anything to this extraordinary pronouncement professor trelawney delicately rearranged her shawl and continued so you have chosen to study divination the most difficult of all magical arts i must warn you at the outset that if you do not have the sight there is very little i will be able to teach you books can take you only so far in this field at these words both harry and ron glanced grinning at hermione who looked startled at the news that books wouldnt be much help in this subject many witches and wizards talented though they are in the area of loud bangs and smells and sudden disappearings are yet unable to penetrate the veiled mysteries of the future professor trelawney went on her enormous gleaming eyes moving from face to nervous face it is a gift granted to few you boy she said suddenly to neville who almost toppled off his pouf is your grandmother well i think so said neville tremulously i wouldnt be so sure if i were you dear said professor trelawney the firelight glinting on her long emerald earrings neville gulped professor trelawney continued placidly we will be covering the basic methods of divination this year the first term will be devoted to reading the tea leaves next term we shall progress to palmistry by the way my dear she shot suddenly at parvati patil beware a redhaired man parvati gave a startled look at ron who was right behind her and edged her chair away from him in the second term professor trelawney went on we shall progress to the crystal ball if we have finished with fire omens that is unfortunately classes will be disrupted in february by a nasty bout of flu i myself will lose my voice and around easter one of our number will leave us forever a very tense silence followed this pronouncement but professor trelawney seemed unaware of it i wonder dear she said to lavender brown who was nearest and shrank back in her chair if you could pass me the largest silver teapot lavender looking relieved stood up took an enormous teapot from the shelf and put it down on the table in front of professor trelawney thank you my dear incidentally that thing you are dreading it will happen on friday the sixteenth of october lavender trembled now i want you all to divide into pairs collect a teacup from the shelf come to me and i will fill it then sit down and drink drink until only the dregs remain swill these around the cup three times with the left hand then turn the cup upside down on its saucer wait for the last of the tea to drain away then give your cup to your partner to read you will interpret the patterns using pages five and six of unfogging the future i shall move among you helping and instructing oh and dear she caught neville by the arm as he made to stand up after youve broken your first cup would you be so kind as to select one of the blue patterned ones im rather attached to the pink sure enough neville had no sooner reached the shelf of teacups when there was a tinkle of breaking china professor trelawney swept over to him holding a dustpan and brush and said one of the blue ones then dear if you wouldnt mind thank you when harry and ron had had their teacups filled they went back to their table and tried to drink the scalding tea quickly they swilled the dregs around as professor trelawney had instructed then drained the cups and swapped over right said ron as they both opened their books at pages five and six what can you see in mine a load of soggy brown stuff said harry the heavily perfumed smoke in the room was making him feel sleepy and stupid broaden your minds my dears and allow your eyes to see past the mundane professor trelawney cried through the gloom harry tried to pull himself together right youve got a crooked sort of cross he consulted unfogging the future that means youre going to have trials and suffering sorry about that but theres a thing that could be the sun hang on that means great happiness so youre going to suffer but be very happy you need your inner eye tested if you ask me said ron and they both had to stifle their laughs as professor trelawney gazed in their direction my turn ron peered into harrys teacup his forehead wrinkled with effort theres a blob a bit like a bowler hat he said maybe youre going to work for the ministry of magic he turned the teacup the other way up but this way it looks more like an acorn whats that he scanned his copy of unfogging the future a windfall unexpected gold excellent you can lend me some and theres a thin here he turned the cup again that looks like an animal yeah if that was its head it looks like a hippo no a sheep professor trelawney whirled around as harry let out a snort of laughter let me see that my dear she said reprovingly to ron sweeping over and snatching harrys cup from him everyone went quiet to watch professor trelawney was staring into the teacup rotating it counterclockwise the falcon my dear you have a deadly enemy but everyone knows that said hermione in a loud whisper professor trelawney stared at her well they do said hermione everybody knows about harry and youknowwho harry and ron stared at her with a mixture of amazement and admiration they had never heard hermione speak to a teacher like that before professor trelawney chose not to reply she lowered her huge eyes to harrys cup again and continued to turn it the club an attack dear dear this is not a happy cup i thought that was a bowler hat said ron sheepishly the skull danger in your path my dear everyone was staring transfixed at professor trelawney who gave the cup a final turn gasped and then screamed there was another tinkle of breaking china neville had smashed his second cup professor trelawney sank into a vacant armchair her glittering hand at her heart and her eyes closed my dear boy my poor dear boy no it is kinder not to say nodont ask me what is it professor said dean thomas at once everyone had got to their feet and slowly they crowded around harry and rons table pressing close to professor trelawneys chair to get a good look at harrys cup my dear professor trelawneys huge eyes opened dramatically you have the grim the what said harry he could tell that he wasnt the only one who didnt understand dean thomas shrugged at him and lavender brown looked puzzled but nearly everybody else clapped their hands to their mouths in horror the grim my dear the grim cried professor trelawney who looked shocked that harry hadnt understood the giant spectral dog that haunts churchyards my dear boy it is an omen the worst omen of death harrys stomach lurched that dog on the cover of death omens in flourish and blotts the dog in the shadows of magnolia crescentlavender brown clapped her hands to her mouth too everyone was looking at harry everyone except hermione who had gotten up and moved around to the back of professor trelawneys chair i dont think it looks like a grim she said flatly professor trelawney surveyed hermione with mounting dislike youll forgive me for saying so my dear but i perceive very little aura around you very little receptivity to the resonances of the future seamus finnigan was tilting his head from side to side it looks like a grim if you do this he said with his eyes almost shut but it looks more like a donkey from here he said leaning to the left when youve all finished deciding whether im going to die or not said harry taking even himself by surprise now nobody seemed to want to look at him i think we will leave the lesson here for today said professor trelawney in her mistiest voice yes please pack away your things silently the class took their teacups back to professor trelawney packed away their books and closed their bags even ron was avoiding harrys eyes until we meet again said professor trelawney faintly fair fortune be yours oh and dear she pointed at neville youll be late next time so mind you work extrahard to catch up harry ron and hermione descended professor trelawneys ladder and the winding stair in silence then set off for professor mcgonagalls transfiguration lesson it took them so long to find her classroom that early as they had left divination they were only just in time harry chose a seat right at the back of the room feeling as though he were sitting in a very bright spotlight the rest of the class kept shooting furtive glances at him as though he were about to drop dead at any moment he hardly heard what professor mcgonagall was telling them about animagi wizards who could transform at will into animals and wasnt even watching when she transformed herself in front of their eyes into a tabby cat with spectacle markings around her eyes really what has got into you all today said professor mcgonagall turning back into herself with a faint pop and staring around at them all not that it matters but thats the first time my transformations not got applause from a class everybodys heads turned toward harry again but nobody spoke then hermione raised her hand please professor weve just had our first divination class and we were reading the tea leaves and ah of course said professor mcgonagall suddenly frowning there is no need to say any more miss granger tell me which of you will be dying this year everyone stared at her me said harry finally i see said professor mcgonagall fixing harry with her beady eyesthen you should know potter that sibyll trelawney has predicted the death of one student a year since she arrived at this school none of them has died yet seeing death omens is her favorite way of greeting a new class if it were not for the fact that i never speak ill of my colleagues professor mcgonagall broke off and they saw that her nostrils had gone white she went on more calmly divination is one of the most imprecise branches of magic i shall not conceal from you that i have very little patience with it true seers are very rare and professor trelawney she stopped again and then said in a very matteroffact tone you look in excellent health to me potter so you will excuse me if i dont let you off homework today i assure you that if you die you need not hand it in hermione laughed harry felt a bit better it was harder to feel scared of a lump of tea leaves away from the dim red light and befuddling perfume of professor trelawneys classroom not everyone was convinced however ron still looked worried and lavender whispered but what about nevilles cup when the transfiguration class had finished they joined the crowd thundering toward the great hall for lunch ron cheer up said hermione pushing a dish of stew toward him you heard what professor mcgonagall said ron spooned stew onto his plate and picked up his fork but didnt start harry he said in a low serious voice you havent seen a great black dog anywhere have you yeah i have said harry i saw one the night i left the dursleys ron let his fork fall with a clatter probably a stray said hermione calmly ron looked at hermione as though she had gone mad hermione if harrys seen a grim thats thats bad he said my my uncle bilius saw one and and he died twentyfour hours later coincidence said hermione airily pouring herself some pumpkin juice you dont know what youre talking about said ron starting to get angry grims scare the living daylights out of most wizards there you are then said hermione in a superior tone they see the grim and die of fright the grims not an omen its the cause of death and harrys still with us because hes not stupid enough to see one and think right well id better kick the bucket then ron mouthed wordlessly at hermione who opened her bag took out her new arithmancy book and propped it open against the juice jug i think divination seems very woolly she said searching for her page a lot of guesswork if you ask me there was nothing woolly about the grim in that cup said ron hotly you didnt seem quite so confident when you were telling harry it was a sheep said hermione coolly professor trelawney said you didnt have the right aura you just dont like being bad at something for a change he had touched a nerve hermione slammed her arithmancy book down on the table so hard that bits of meat and carrot flew everywhere if being good at divination means i have to pretend to see death omens in a lump of tea leaves im not sure ill be studying it much longer that lesson was absolute rubbish compared with my arithmancy class she snatched up her bag and stalked away ron frowned after her whats she talking about he said to harry she hasnt been to an arithmancy class yet harry was pleased to get out of the castle after lunch yesterdays rain had cleared the sky was a clear pale gray and the grass was springy and damp underfoot as they set off for their first ever care of magical creatures class ron and hermione werent speaking to each other harry walked beside them in silence as they went down the sloping lawns to hagrids hut on the edge of the forbidden forest it was only when he spotted three onlytoo familiar backs ahead of them that he realized they must be having these lessons with the slytherins malfoy was talking animatedly to crabbe and goyle who were chortling harry was quite sure he knew what they were talking about hagrid was waiting for his class at the door of his hut he stood in his moleskin overcoat with fang the boarhound at his heels looking impatient to start cmon now get a move on he called as the class approached got a real treat for yeh today great lesson comin up everyone here right follow me for one nasty moment harry thought that hagrid was going to lead them into the forest harry had had enough unpleasant experiences in there to last him a lifetime however hagrid strolled off around the edge of the trees and five minutes later they found themselves outside a kind of paddock there was nothing in there everyone gather round the fence here he called thats it make sure yeh can see now firs thing yehll want ter do is open yer books how said the cold drawling voice of draco malfoy eh said hagrid how do we open our books malfoy repeated he took out his copy of the monster book of monsters which he had bound shut with a length of rope other people took theirs out too some like harry had belted their book shut others had crammed them inside tight bags or clamped them together with binder clips hasn hasn anyone bin able ter open their books said hagrid looking crestfallen the class all shook their heads yehve got ter stroke em said hagrid as though this was the most obvious thing in the world look he took hermiones copy and ripped off the spellotape that bound it the book tried to bite but hagrid ran a giant forefinger down its spine and the book shivered and then fell open and lay quiet in his hand oh how silly weve all been malfoy sneered we should have stroked them why didnt we guess i i thought they were funny hagrid said uncertainly to hermione oh tremendously funny said malfoy really witty giving us books that try and rip our hands off shut up malfoy said harry quietly hagrid was looking downcast and harry wanted hagrids first lesson to be a success righ then said hagrid who seemed to have lost his thread so so yehve got yer books an an now yeh need the magical creatures yeah so ill go an get em hang on he strode away from them into the forest and out of sight god this place is going to the dogs said malfoy loudly that oaf teaching classes my fatherll have a fit when i tell him shut up malfoy harry repeated careful potter theres a dementor behind you oooooooh squealed lavender brown pointing toward the opposite side of the paddock trotting toward them were a dozen of the most bizarre creatures harry had ever seen they had the bodies hind legs and tails of horses but the front legs wings and heads of what seemed to be giant eagles with cruel steelcolored beaks and large brilliantly orange eyes the talons on their front legs were half a foot long and deadly looking each of the beasts had a thick leather collar around its neck which was attached to a long chain and the ends of all of these were held in the vast hands of hagrid who came jogging into the paddock behind the creatures gee up there he roared shaking the chains and urging the creatures toward the fence where the class stood everyone drew back slightly as hagrid reached them and tethered the creatures to the fence hippogriffs hagrid roared happily waving a hand at them beauiful aren they harry could sort of see what hagrid meant once you got over the first shock of seeing something that was half horse half bird you started to appreciate the hippogriffs gleaming coats changing smoothly from feather to hair each of them a different color stormy gray bronze pinkish roan gleaming chestnut and inky black so said hagrid rubbing his hands together and beaming around if yeh wan ter come a bit nearer no one seemed to want to harry ron and hermione however approached the fence cautiously now firs thing yeh gotta know abou hippogriffs is theyre proud said hagrid easily offended hippogriffs are dont ever insult one cause it might be the last thing yeh do malfoy crabbe and goyle werent listening they were talking in an undertone and harry had a nasty feeling they were plotting how best to disrupt the lesson yeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs move hagrid continued its polite see yeh walk toward him and yeh bow an yeh wait if he bows back yehre allowed ter touch him if he doesn bow then get away from him sharpish cause those talons hurt right who wants ter go first most of the class backed farther away in answer even harry ron and hermione had misgivings the hippogriffs were tossing their fierce heads and flexing their powerful wings they didnt seem to like being tethered like this no one said hagrid with a pleading look ill do it said harry there was an intake of breath from behind him and both lavender and parvati whispered oooh no harry remember your tea leaves harry ignored them he climbed over the paddock fence good man harry roared hagrid right then lets see how yeh get on with buckbeak he untied one of the chains pulled the gray hippogriff away from its fellows and slipped off its leather collar the class on the other side of the paddock seemed to be holding its breath malfoys eyes were narrowed maliciously easy now harry said hagrid quietly yehve got eye contact now try not ter blink hippogriffs don trust yeh if yeh blink too much harrys eyes immediately began to water but he didnt shut thern buckbeak had turned his great sharp head and was staring at harry with one fierce orange eye thas it said hagrid thas it harry now bow harry didnt feel much like exposing the back of his neck to buckbeak but he did as he was told he gave a short bow and then looked up the hippogriff was still staring haughtily at him it didnt move ah said hagrid sounding worried right back away now harry easy does it but then to harrys enormous surprise the hippogriff suddenly bent its scaly front knees and sank into what was an unmistakable bow well done harry said hagrid ecstatic right yeh can touch him pat his beak go on feeling that a better reward would have been to back away harry moved slowly toward the hippogriff and reached out toward it he patted the beak several times and the hippogriff closed its eyes lazily as though enjoying it the class broke into applause all except for malfoy crabbe and goyle who were looking deeply disappointed righ then harry said hagrid i reckon he might let yeh ride him this was more than harry had bargained for he was used to a broomstick but he wasnt sure a hippogriff would be quite the same yeh climb up there jus behind the wing joint said hagrid an mind yeh don pull any of his feathers out he won like that harry put his foot on the top of buckbeaks wing and hoisted himself onto its back buckbeak stood up harry wasnt sure where to hold on everything in front of him was covered with feathers go on then roared hagrid slapping the hippogriffs hindquarters without warning twelvefoot wings flapped open on either side of harry he just had time to seize the hippogriff around the neck before he was soaring upward it was nothing like a broomstick and harry knew which one he preferred the hippogriffs wings beat uncomfortably on either side of him catching him under his legs and making him feel he was about to be thrown off the glossy feathers slipped under his fingers and he didnt dare get a stronger grip instead of the smooth action of his nimbus two thousand he now felt himself rocking backward and forward as the hindquarters of the hippogriff rose and fell with its wings buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to the ground this was the bit harry had been dreading he leaned back as the smooth neck lowered feeling he was going to slip off over the beak then felt a heavy thud as the four illassorted feet hit the ground he just managed to hold on and push himself straight again good work harry roared hagrid as everyone except malfoy crabbe and goyle cheered okay who else wants a go emboldened by harrys success the rest of the class climbed cautiously into the paddock hagrid untied the hippogriffs one by one and soon people were bowing nervously all over the paddock neville ran repeatedly backward from his which didnt seem to want to bend its knees ron and hermione practiced on the chestnut while harry watched malfoy crabbe and goyle had taken over buckbeak he had bowed to malfoy who was now patting his beak looking disdainful this is very easy malfoy drawled loud enough for harry to hear him i knew it must have been if potter could do it i bet youre not dangerous at all are you he said to the hippogriff are you you great ugly brute it happened in a flash of steely talons malfoy let out a highpitched scream and next moment hagrid was wrestling buckbeak back into his collar as he strained to get at malfoy who lay curled in the grass blood blossoming over his robes im dying malfoy yelled as the class panicked im dying look at me its killed me yer not dyin said hagrid who had gone very white someone help me gotta get him outta here hermione ran to hold open the gate as hagrid lifted malfoy easily as they passed harry saw that there was a long deep gash on malfoys arm blood splattered the grass and hagrid ran with him up the slope toward the castle very shaken the care of magical creatures class followed at a walk the slytherins were all shouting about hagrid they should fire him straight away said pansy parkinson who was in tears it was malfoys fault snapped dean thomas crabbe and goyle flexed their muscles threateningly they all climbed the stone steps into the deserted entrance hall im going to see if hes okay said pansy and they all watched her run up the marble staircase the slytherins still muttering about hagrid headed away in the direction of their dungeon common room harry ron and hermione proceeded upstairs to gryffindor tower you think hell be all right said hermione nervously course he will madam pomfrey can mend cuts in about a second said harry who had had far worse injuries mended magically by the nurse that was a really bad thing to happen in hagrids first class though wasnt it said ron looking worried trust malfoy to mess things up for him they were among the first to reach the great hall at dinnertime hoping to see hagrid but he wasnt there they wouldnt fire him would they said hermione anxiously not touching her steakand kidney pudding theyd better not said ron who wasnt eating either harry was watching the slytherin table a large group including crabbe and goyle was huddled together deep in conversation harry was sure they were cooking up their own version of how malfoy had been injured well you cant say it wasnt an interesting first day back said ron gloomily they went up to the crowded gryffindor common room after dinner and tried to do the homework professor mcgonagall had given them but all three of them kept breaking off and glancing out of the tower window theres a light on in hagrids window harry said suddenly ron looked at his watch if we hurried we could go down and see him its still quite early i dont know hermione said slowly and harry saw her glance at him im allowed to walk across the grounds he said pointedly sirius black hasnt got past the dementors yet has he so they put their things away and headed out of the portrait hole glad to meet nobody on their way to the front doors as they werent entirely sure they were supposed to be out the grass was still wet and looked almost black in the twilight when they reached hagrids hut they knocked and a voice growled cmin hagrid was sitting in his shirtsleeves at his scrubbed wooden table his boarhound fang had his head in hagrids lap one look told them that hagrid had been drinking a lot there was a pewter tankard almost as big as a bucket in front of him and he seemed to be having difficulty getting them into focus spect its a record he said thickly when he recognized them don reckon theyve ever had a teacher who lasted ony a day before you havent been fired hagrid gasped hermione not yet said hagrid miserably taking a huge gulp of whatever was in the tankard buts only a matter o time i nt it after malfoy how is he said ron as they all sat down it wasnt serious was it madam pomfrey fixed him best she could said hagrid dully but hes sayin its still agony covered in bandages moanin hes faking it said harry at once madam pomfrey can mend anything she regrew half my bones last year trust malfoy to milk it for all its worth school govnors have bin told o course said hagrid miseribly they reckon i started too big shoulda left hippogriffs fer later done flobberworms or summat jus thought itd make a good firs lessons all my fault its all malfoys fault hagrid said hermione earnestly were witnesses said harry you said hippogriffs attack if you insult them its malfoys problem that he wasnt listening well tell dumbledore what really happened yeah dont worry hagrid well back you up said ron tears leaked out of the crinkled corners of hagrids beetleblack eyes he grabbed both harry and ron and pulled them into a bonebreaking hug i think youve had enough to drink hagrid said hermione firmly she took the tankard from the table and went outside to empty it ah maybe shes right said hagrid letting go of harry and ron who both staggered away rubbing their ribs hagrid heaved himself out of his chair and followed hermione unsteadily outside they heard a loud splash whats he done said harry nervously as hermione came back in with the empty tankard stuck his head in the water barrel said hermione putting the tankard away hagrid came back his long hair and beard sopping wet wiping the water out of his eyes thats better he said shaking his head like a dog and drenching them all listen it was good of yeh ter come an see me i really hagrid stopped dead staring at harry as though hed only just realized he was there what dyeh think youre doin eh he roared so suddenly that they jumped a foot in the air yehre not to go wanderin around after dark harry an you two lettin him hagrid strode over to harry grabbed his arm and pulled him to the door cmon hagrid said angrily im takin yer all back up ter school an don let me catch yeh walkin down ter see me after dark again im not worth that chapter seven the boggart in the wardrobe malfoy didnt reappear in classes until late on thursday morning when the slytherins and gryffindors were halfway through double potions he swaggered into the dungeon his right arm covered in bandages and bound up in a sling acting in harrys opinion as though he were the heroic survivor of some dreadful battle how is it draco simpered pansy parkinson does it hurt much yeah said malfoy putting on a brave sort of grimace but harry saw him wink at crabbe and goyle when pansy had looked away settle down settle down said professor snape idly harry and ron scowled at each other snape wouldnt have said settle down if theyd walked in late hed have given them detention but malfoy had always been able to get away with anything in snapes classes snape was head of slytherin house and generality favored his own students above all others they were making a new potion today a shrinking solution malfoy set up his cauldron right next to harry and ron so that they were preparing their ingredients on the same table sir malfoy called sir ill need help cutting up these daisy roots because of my arm weasley cut up malfoys roots for him said snape without looking up ron went brick red theres nothing wrong with your arm he hissed at malfoy malfoy smirked across the table weasley you heard professor snape cut up these roots ron seized his knife pulled malfoys roots toward him and began to chop them roughly so that they were all different sizes professor drawled malfoy weasleys mutilating my roots sir snape approached their table stared down his hooked nose at the roots then gave ron an unpleasant smile from beneath his long greasy black hair change roots with malfoy weasley but sir ron had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully shredding his own roots into exactly equal pieces now said snape in his most dangerous voice ron shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the table malfoy then took up the knife again and sir ill need this shrivelfig skinned said malfoy his voice full of malicious laughter potter you can skin malfoys shrivelfig said snape giving harry the look of loathing he always reserved just for him harry took malfoys shrivelfig as ron began trying to repair the damage to the roots he now had to use harry skinned the shrivelfig as fast as he could and flung it back across the table at malfoy without speaking malfoy was smirking more broadly than ever seen your pal hagrid lately he asked them quietly none of your business said ron jerkily without looking up im afraid he wont be a teacher much longer said malfoy in a tone of mock sorrow fathers not very happy about my injury keep talking malfoy and ill give you a real injury snarled ron hes complained to the school governors and to the ministry of magic fathers got a lot of influence you know and a lasting injury like this he gave a huge fake sigh who knows if my armll ever be the same again so thats why youre putting it on said harry accidentally beheading a dead caterpillar because his hand was shaking in anger to try to get hagrid fired well said malfoy lowering his voice to a whisper partly potter but there are other benefits too weasley slice my caterpillars for me a few cauldrons away neville was in trouble neville regularly went to pieces in potions lessons it was his worst subject and his great fear of professor snape made things ten times worse his potion which was supposed to be a bright acid green had turned orange longbottom said snape ladling some up and allowing to splash back into the cauldron so that everyone could see orange tell me boy does anything penetrate that thick skull of yours didnt you hear me say quite clearly that only one spleen was needed didnt i state plainly that a dash of leech juice would suffice what do i have to do to make you understand longbottom neville was pink and trembling he looked as though he was on the verge of tears please sir said hermione please i could help neville put it right i dont remember asking you to show off miss granger said snape coldly and hermione went as pink as neville longbottom at the end of this lesson we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad and see what happens perhaps that will encourage you to do it properly snape moved away leaving neville breathless with fear help me he moaned to hermione hey harry said seamus finnigan leaning over to borrow harrys brass scales have you heard daily prophet this morning they reckon sirius blacks been sighted where said harry and ron quickly on the other side of the table malfoy looked up listening closely not too far from here said seamus who looked excited it was a muggle who saw him course she didnt really understand the muggles think hes just an ordinary criminal dont they so she phoned the telephone hot line by the time the ministry of magic got there he was gone not too far from here ron repeated looking significantly at harry he turned around and saw malfoy watching closely what malfoy need something else skinned but malfoys eyes were shining malevolently and they were fixed at harry he leaned across the table thinking ff trying to catch black singlehanded potter yeah thats right said harry offhandedly malfoys thin mouth was curving in a mean smile of course if it was me he said quietly id have done something before now i wouldnt be staying in school like a good boy id be out there looking for him what are you talking about malfoy said ron roughly dont you know potter breathed malfoy his pate eyes narrowed know what malfoy let out a low sneering laugh maybe youd rather not risk your neck he said want to leave it to the dementors do you but if it was me id want revenge id hunt him down myself what are you talking about said harry angrily but at that moment snape called you should have finished adding your ingredients by now this potion needs to stew before it can be drunk so clear away while it simmers and then well test longbottoms crabbe and goyle laughed openly watching neville sweat as he stirred his potion feverishly hermione was muttering instructions to him out of the corner of her mouth so that snape wouldnt see harry and ron packed away their unused ingredients and went to wash their hands and ladles in the stone basin in the corner what did malfoy mean harry muttered to ron as he stuck his hands under the icy jet that poured from the gargoyles mouth why would i want revenge on black he hasnt done anything to me yet hes making it up said ron savagely hes trying to make you do something stupid the end of the lesson in sight snape strode over to neville who was cowering by his cauldron everyone gather round said snape his black eyes glittering and watch what happens to longbottoms toad if he has managed to produce a shrinking solution it will shrink to a tadpole if as i dont doubt he has done it wrong his toad is likely to be poisoned the gryffindors watched fearfully the slytherins looked excited snape picked up trevor the toad in his left hand and dipped a small spoon into nevilles potion which was now green he trickled a few drops down trevors throat there was a moment of hushed silence in which trevor gulped then there was a small pop and trevor the tadpole was wriggling in snapes palm the gryffindors burst into applause snape looking sour pulled a small bottle from the pocket of his robe poured a few drops on top of trevor and he reappeared suddenly fully grown five points from gryffindor said snape which wiped the smiles from every face i told you not to help him miss granger class dismissed harry ron and hermione climbed the steps to the entrance hall harry was still thinking about what malfoy had said while ron was seething about snape five points from gryffindor because the potion was all right why didnt you lie hermione you shouldve said neville did it all by himself hermione didnt answer ron looked around where is she harry turned too they were at the top of the steps now watching the rest of the class pass them heading for the great hall and lunch she was right behind us said ron frowning malfoy passed them walking between crabbe and goyle he smirked at harry and disappeared there she is said harry hermione was panting slightly hurrying up the stairs one hand clutched her bag the other seemed to be tucking something down the front of her robes how did you do that said ron what said hermione joining them one minute you were right behind us the next moment you were back at the bottom of the stairs again what hermione looked slightly confused oh i had to go back for something oh no a seam had split on hermiones bag harry wasnt surprised he could see that it was crammed with at least a dozen large and heavy books why are you carrying all these around with you ron asked her you know how many subjects im taking said hermione breathlessly couldnt hold these for me could you but ron was turning over the books she had handed him looking at the covers you havent got any of these subjects today its only defense against the dark arts this afternoon oh yes said hermione vaguely but she packed all the books back into her bag just the same i hope theres something good for lunch im starving she added and she marched off toward the great hall dyou get the feeling hermiones not telling us something ron asked harry professor lupin wasnt there when they arrived at his first defense against the dark arts lesson they all sat down took out their books quills and parchment and were talking when he finally entered the room lupin smiled vaguely and placed his tatty old briefcase on the teachers desk he was as shabby as ever but looked healthier than he had on the train as though he had had a few square meals good afternoon he said would you please put all your books back in your bags todays will be a practical lesson you will need only your wands a few curious looks were exchanged as the class put away their books they had never had a practical defense against the dark arts before unless you counted the memorable class last year when their old teacher had brought a cageful of pixies to class and set them loose right then said professor lupin when everyone was ready if youd follow me puzzled but interested the class got to its feet and followed professor lupin out of the classroom he led them along the deserted corridor and around a corner where the first thing they saw was peeves the poltergeist who was floating upside down in midair and stuffing the nearest keyhole with chewing gum peeves didnt look up until professor lupin was two feet away then he wiggled his curlytoed feet and broke into song loony loopy lupin peeves sang loony loopy lupin loony loopy lupin rude and unmanageable as he almost always was peeves usually showed some respect toward the teachers everyone looked quickly at professor lupin to see how he would take this to their surprise he was still smiling id take that gum out of the keyhole if i were you peeves he said pleasantly mr filch wont be able to get in to his brooms filch was the hogwarts caretaker a badtempered failed wizard who waged a constant war against the students and indeed peeves however peeves paid no attention to professor lupins words except to blow a loud wet raspberry professor lupin gave a small sigh and took out his wand this is a useful little spell he told the class over his shoulder please watch closely he raised the wand to shoulder height said waddiwasi and pointed it at peeves with the force of a bullet the wad of chewing gum shot out of the keyhole and straight down peevess left nostril he whirled upright and zoomed away cursing cool sir said dean thomas in amazement thank you dean said professor lupin putting his wand away again shall we proceed they set off again the class looking at shabby professor lupin with increased respect he led them down a second corridor and stopped right outside the staffroom door inside please said professor lupin opening it and standing back the staffroom a long paneled room full of old mismatched chairs was empty except for one teacher professor snape was sitting in a low armchair and he looked around as the class filled in his eyes were glittering and there was a nasty sneer playing around his mouth as professor lupin came in and made to close the door behind him snape said leave it open lupin id rather not witness this he got to his feet and strode past the class his black robes billowing behind him at the doorway he turned on his heel and said possibly no ones warned you lupin but this class contains neville longbottom i would advise you not to entrust him with anything difficult not unless miss granger is hissing instructions in his ear neville went scarlet harry glared at snape it was bad enough that he bullied neville in his own classes let alone doing it in front of other teachers professor lupin had raised his eyebrows i was hoping that neville would assist me with the first stage of the operation he said and i am sure he will perform it admirably nevilles face went if possible even redder snapes lip curled but he left shutting the door with a snap now then said professor lupin beckoning the class toward the end of the room where there was nothing but an old wardrobe where the teachers kept their spare robes as professor lupin went to stand next to it the wardrobe gave a sudden wobble banging off the wall nothing to worry about said professor lupin calmly because a few people had jumped backward in alarm theres a boggart in there most people seemed to feel that this was something to worry about neville gave professor lupin a look of pure terror and seamus finnigan eyed the now rattling doorknob apprehensively boggarts like dark enclosed spaces said professor lupin wardrobes the gap beneath beds the cupboards under sinks ive even met one that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock this one moved in yesterday afternoon and i asked the headmaster if the staff would leave it to give my third years some practice so the first question we must ask ourselves is what is a boggart hermione put up her hand its a shapeshifter she said it can take the shape of whatever it thinks will frighten us most couldnt have put it better myself said professor lupin and hermione glowed so the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a form he does not yet know what will frighten the person on the other side of the door nobody knows what a boggart looks like when he is alone but when i let him out he will immediately become whatever each of us most fears this means said professor lupin choosing to ignore nevilles small sputter of terror that we have a huge advantage over the boggart before we begin have you spotted it harry trying to answer a question with hermione next to him bobbing up and down on the balls of her feet with her hand in the air was very offputting but harry had a go er because there are so many of us it wont know what shape it should be precisely said professor lupin and hermione put her hand down looking a little disappointed its always best to have company when youre dealing with a boggart he becomes confused which should he become a headless corpse or a flesheating slug i once saw a boggart make that very mistake tried to frighten two people at once and turned himself into half a slug not remotely frightening the charm that repels a boggart is simple yet it requires force of mind you see the thing that really finishes a boggart is laughter what you need to do is force it to assume a shape that you find amusing we will practice the charm without wands first after me please riddikulus riddikulus said the class together good said professor lupin very good but that was the easy part im afraid you see the word alone is not enough and this is where you come in neville the wardrobe shook again though not as much as neville who walked forward as though he were heading for the gallows right neville said professor lupin first things first what would you say is the thing that frightens you most in the world nevilles lips moved but no noise came out didnt catch that neville sorry said professor lupin cheerfully neville looked around rather wildly as though begging someone to help him then said in barely more than a whisper professor snape nearly everyone laughed even neville grinned apologetically professor lupin however looked thoughtful professor snape hmmm neville i believe you live with your grandmother er yes said neville nervously but i dont want the boggart to turn into her either no no you misunderstand me said professor lupin now smiling i wonder could you tell us what sort of clothes your grandmother usually wears neville looked startled but said well always the same hat a tall one with a stuffed vulture on top and a long dress green normally and sometimes a foxfur scarf and a handbag prompted professor lupin a big red one said neville right then said professor lupin can you picture those clothes very clearly neville can you see them in your minds eye yes said neville uncertainty plainly wondering what was coming next when the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe neville and sees you it will assume the form of professor snape said lupin and you will raise your wand thus and cry riddikulus and concentrate hard on your grandmothers clothes if all goes well professor boggart snape will be forced into that vulturetopped hat and that green dress with that big red handbag there was a great shout of laughter the wardrobe wobbled more violently if neville is successful the boggart is likely to shift his attention to each of us in turn said professor lupin i would like all of you to take a moment now to think of the thing that scares you most and imagine how you might force it to look comical the room went quiet harry thought what scared him most in the world his first thought was lord voldemort a voldemort returned to full strength but before he had even started to plan a possible counterattack on a boggartvoldemort a horrible image came floating to the surface of his mind a rotting glistening hand slithering back beneath a black cloak a long rattling breath from an unseen mouth then a cold so penetrating it felt like drowning harry shivered then looked around hoping no one had noticed many people had their eyes shut tight ron was muttering to himself take its legs off harry was sure he knew what that was about rons greatest fear was spiders everyone ready said professor lupin harry felt a lurch of fear he wasnt ready how could you make a dementor less frightening but he didnt want to ask for more time everyone else was nodding and rolling up their sleeves neville were going to back away said professor lupin let you have a clear field all right ill call the next person forward everyone back now so neville can get a clear shot they all retreated backed against the walls leaving neville alone beside the wardrobe he looked pale and frightened but he had pushed up the sleeves of his robes and was holding his wand ready on the count of three neville said professor lupin who was pointing his own wand at the handle of the wardrobe one two three now a jet of sparks shot from the end of professor lupins wand and hit the doorknob the wardrobe burst open hooknosed and menacing professor snape stepped out his eyes flashing at neville neville backed away his wand up mouthing wordlessly snape was bearing down upon him reaching inside his robes r r riddikulus squeaked neville there was a noise like a whip crack snape stumbled he was wearing a long lacetrimmed dress and a towering hat topped with a motheaten vulture and he was swinging a huge crimson handbag there was a roar of laughter the boggart paused confused and professor lupin shouted parvati forward parvati walked forward her face set snape rounded on her there was another crack and where he had stood was a bloodstained bandaged mummy its sightless face was turned to parvati and it began to walk toward her very slowly dragging its feet its stiff arms rising riddikulus cried parvati a bandage unraveled at the mummys feet it became entangled fell face forward and its head rolled off seamus roared professor lupin seamus darted past parvati crack where the mummy had been was a woman with floorlength black hair and a skeletal greentinged face a banshee she opened her mouth wide and an unearthly sound filled the room a long wailing shriek that made the hair on harrys head stand on end riddikulus shouted seamus the banshee made a rasping noise and clutched her throat her voice was gone crack the banshee turned into a rat which chased its tail in a circle then crack became a rattlesnake which slithered and writhed before crack becoming a single bloody eyeball its confused shouted lupin were getting there dean dean hurried forward crack the eyeball became a severed hand which flipped over and began to creep along the floor like a crab riddikulus yelled dean there was a snap and the hand was trapped in a mousetrap excellent ron you next ron leapt forward crack quite a few people screamed a giant spider six feet tall and covered in hair was advancing on ron clicking its pincers menacingly for a moment harry thought ron had frozen then riddikulus bellowed ron and the spiders legs vanished it rolled over and over lavender brown squealed and ran out of its way and it came to a halt at harrys feet he raised his wand ready but here shouted professor lupin suddenly hurrying forward crack the legless spider had vanished for a second everyone looked wildly around to see where it was then they saw a silverywhite orb hanging in the air in front of lupin who said riddikulus almost lazily crack forward neville and finish him off said lupin as the boggart landed on the floor as a cockroach crack snape was back this time neville charged forward looking determined riddikulus he shouted and they had a split seconds view of snape in his lacy dress before neville let out a great ha of laughter and the boggart exploded burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke and was gone excellent cried professor lupin as the class broke into applause excellent neville well done everyone let me see five points to gryffindor for every person to tackle the boggart ten for neville because he did it twice and five each to hermione and harry but i didnt do anything said harry you and hermione answered my questions correctly at the start of the class harry lupin said lightly very well everyone an excellent lesson homework kindly read the chapter on boggarts and summarize it for me to be handed in on monday that will be all talking excitedly the class left the staffroom harry however wasnt feeling cheerful professor lupin had deliberately stopped him from tackling the boggart why was it because hed seen harry collapse on the train and thought he wasnt up to much had he thought harry would pass out again but no one else seemed to have noticed anything did you see me take that banshee shouted seamus and the hand said dean waving his own around and snape in that hat and my mummy i wonder why professor lupins frightened of crystal balls said lavender thoughtfully that was the best defense against the dark arts lesson weve ever had wasnt it said ron excitedly as they made their way back to the classroom to get their bags he seems like a very good teacher said hermione approvingly but i wish i could have had a turn with the boggart what would it have been for you said ron sniggering a piece of homework that only got nine out of ten chapter eight flight of the fat fady in no time at all defense against the dark arts had become most peoples favorite class only draco malfoy and his gang of slytherins had anything bad to say about professor lupin look at the state of his robes malfoy would say in a loud whisper as professor lupin passed he dresses like our old house elf but no one else cared that professor lupins robes were patched and frayed his next few lessons were just as interesting as the first after boggarts they studied red caps nasty little goblin like creatures that lurked wherever there had been bloodshed in the dungeons of castles and the potholes of deserted battlefields waiting to bludgeon those who had gotten lost from red caps they moved on to kappas creepy waterdwellers that looked like scaly monkeys with webbed hands itching to strangle unwitting waders in their ponds harry only wished he was as happy with some of his other classes worst of all was potions snape was in a particularly vindictive mood these days and no one knows in any doubt why the story of the boggart assuming snapes shape and the way that neville had dressed it in his grandmothers clothes had traveled through the school like wildfire snape didnt seem to find it funny his eyes flashed menacingly at the very mention of professor lupins name and he was bullying neville worse than ever harry was also growing to dread the hours he spent in professor trelawneys stifling tower room deciphering lopsided shapes and symbols trying to ignore the way professor trelawneys enormous eyes filled with tears every time she looked at him he couldnt like professer trelawney even though she was treated with respect bordering on reverence by many of the class parvati patil and lavender brown had taken to haunting professor trelawneys tower room at lunch times and always returned with annoyingly superior looks on their faces as though they knew things the others didnt they had also started using hushed voices whenever they spoke to harry as though he were on his deathbed nobody really liked care of magical creatures which after the actionpacked first class had become extremely dull hagrid seemed to have lost his confidence they were now spending lesson after lesson learning how to look after flobberworms which had to be some of the most boring creatures in existence why would anyone bother looking after them said ron after yet another hour of poking shredded lettuce down the flobberworms throats at the start of october however harry had something else to occupy him something so enjoyable it more than made up for his unsatisfactory classes the quidditch season was approaching and o1iver wood captain of the gryffindor team called a meeting on thursday evening to discuss tactics for the new season there were seven people on a quidditch team three chasers whose job it was to score goals by putting the quaffle a red soccersized ball through one of the fiftyfoothigh hoops at each end of the field two beaters who were equipped with heavy bats to repel the bludgers two heavy black balls that zoomed around trying to attack the players a keeper who defended the goal posts and the seeker who had the hardest job of all that of catching the golden snitch a tiny winged walnutsized ball whose capture ended the game and earned the seekers team an extra one hundred and fifty points oliver wood was a burly seventeenyearold now in his seventh and final year at hogwarts there was a quiet sort of desperation in his voice as he addressed his six fellow team members in the chilly locker rooms on the edge of the darkening quidditch field this is our last chance my last chance to win the quidditch cup he told them striding up and down in front of them ill be leaving at the end of this year ill never get another shot at it gryffindor hasnt won for seven years now okay so weve had the worst luck in the world injuries then the tournament getting called off last year wood swallowed as though the memory still brought a lump to his throat but we also know weve got the bestruddyteamintheschool he said punching a fist into his other hand the old manic glint back in his eye weve got three superb chasers wood pointed at alicia spinner angelina johnson and katie bell weve got two unbeatable beaters stop it oliver youre embarrassing us said fred and george weasley together pretending to blush and weve got a seeker who has never failed to win us a match wood rumbled glaring at harry with a kind of furious pride and me he added as an afterthought we think youre very good too oliver said george spanking good keeper said fred the point is wood went on resuming his pacing the quidditch cup should have had our name on it these last two years ever since harry joined the team ive thought the thing was in the bag but we havent got it and this years the last chance well get to finally see our name on the thing wood spoke so dejectedly that even fred and george looked sympathetic oliver this years our year said fred well do it oliver said angelina definitely said harry full of determination the team started training sessions three evenings a week the weather was getting colder and wetter the nights darker but no amount of mud wind or rain could tarnish harrys wonderful vision of finally winning the huge silver quidditch cup harry returned to the gryffindor common room one evening after training cold and stiff but pleased with the way practice had gone to find the room buzzing excitedly whats happened he asked ron and hermione who were sitting in two of the best chairs by the fireside and completing some star charts for astronomy first hogsmeade weekend said ron pointing at a notice that had appeared on the battered old bulletin board end of october halloween excellent said fred who had followed harry through the portrait hole i need to visit zonkos im nearly out of stink pellets harry threw himself into a chair beside ron his high spirits ebbing away hermione seemed to read his mind harry im sure youll be able to go next time she said theyre bound to catch black soon hes been sighted once already blacks not fool enough to try anything in hogsmeade said ron ask mcgonagall if you can go this time harry the next one might not be for ages ron said hermione harrys supposed to stay in school he cant be the only third year left behind said ron ask mcgonagall go on harry yeah i think i will said harry making up his mind hermione opened her mouth to argue but at that moment crookshanks leapt lightly onto her lap a large dead spider was dangling from his mouth does he have to eat that in front of us said ron scowling clever crookshanks did you catch that all by yourself said hermione crookshanks slowly chewed up the spider his yellow eyes fixed insolently on ron just keep him over there thats all said ron irritably turning back to his star chart ive got scabbers asleep in my bag harry yawned he really wanted to go to bed but he still had his own star chart to complete he pulled his bag toward him took out parchment ink and quill and started work you can copy mine if you like said ron labeling his last star with a flourish and shoving the chart toward harry hermione who disapproved of copying pursed her lips but didnt say anything crookshanks was still staring unblinkingly at ron flicking the end of his bushy tail then without warning he pounced oy ron roared seizing his bag as crookshanks sank four sets of claws deep inside it and began tearing ferociously get off you stupid animal ron tried to pull the bag away from crookshanks but crookshanks clung on spitting and slashing ron dont hurt him squealed hermione the whole common room was watching ron whirled the bag around crookshanks still clinging to it and scabbers came flying out of the top catch that cat ron yelled as crookshanks freed himself from the remnants of the bag sprang over the table and chased after the terrified scabbers george weasley made a lunge for crookshanks but missed scabbers streaked through twenty pairs of legs and shot beneath an old chest of drawers crookshanks skidded to a halt crouched low on his bandy legs and started making furious swipes beneath it with his front paw ron and hermione hurried over hermione grabbed crookshanks around the middle and heaved him away ron threw himself onto his stomach and with great difficulty pulled scabbers out by the tail look at him he said furiously to hermione dangling scabbers in front of her hes skin and bone you keep that cat away from him crookshanks doesnt understand its wrong said hermione her voice shaking all cats chase rats ron theres something funny about that animal said ron who was trying to persuade a frantically wiggling scabbers back into his pocket it heard me say that scabbers was in my bag oh what rubbish said hermione impatiently crookshanks could smell him ron how else dyou think that cats got it in for scabbers said ron ignoring the people around him who were starting to giggle and scabbers was here first and hes ill ron marched through the common room and out of sight up the stairs to the boys dormitories ron was still in a bad mood with hermione next day he barely talked to her all through herbology even though he harry and hermione were working together on the same puffapod hows scabbers hermione asked timidly as they stripped fat pink pods from the plants and emptied the shining beans into a wooden pail hes hiding at the bottom of my bed shaking said ron angrily missing the pail and scattering beans over the greenhouse floor careful weasley careful cried professor sprout as the beans burst into bloom before their very eyes they had transfiguration next harry who had resolved to ask professor mcgonagall after the lesson whether he could go into hogsmeade with the rest joined the line outside the class trying to decide how he was going to argue his case he was distracted however by a disturbance at the front of the line lavender brown seemed to be crying parvati had her arm around her and was explaining something to seamus finnigan and dean thomas who were looking very serious whats the matter lavender said hermione anxiously as she harry and ron went to join the group she got a letter from home this morning parvati whispered its her rabbit binky hes been killed by a fox oh said hermione im sorry lavender i should have known said lavender tragically you know what day it is er the sixteenth of october that thing youre dreading it will happen on the sixteenth of october remember she was right she was right the whole class was gathered around lavender now seamus shook his head seriously hermione hesitated then she said you you were dreading binky being killed by a fox well not necessarily by a fox said lavender looking up at hermione with streaming eyes but i was obviously dreading him dying wasnt i oh said hermione she paused again then was binky an old rabbit n no sobbed lavender h he was only a baby parvati tightened her arm around lavenders shoulders but then why would you dread him dying said hermione parvati glared at her well look at it logically said hermione turning to the rest of the groupi mean binky didnt even die today did he lavender just got the news today lavender wailed loudly and she cant have been dreading it because its come as a real shock dont mind hermione lavender said ron loudly she doesnt think other peoples pets matter very much professor mcgonagall opened the classroom door at that moment which was perhaps lucky hermione and ron were looking daggers at each other and when they got into class they seated themselves on either side of harry and didnt talk to each other for the whole class harry still hadnt decided what he was going to say to professor mcgonagall when the bell rang at the end of the lesson but it was she who brought up the subject of hogsmeade first one moment please she called as the class made to leave as youre all in my house you should hand hogsmeade permission forms to me before halloween no form no visiting the village so dont forget neville put up his hand please professor i i think ive lost your grandmother sent yours to me directly longbottom said professor mcgonagall she seemed to think it was safer well thats all you may leave ask her now ron hissed at harry oh but hermione began go for it harry said ron stubbornly harry waited for the rest of the class to disappear then headed nervously for professor mcgonagalls desk yes potter harry took a deep breath professor my aunt and uncle er forgot to sign my form he said professor mcgonagall looked over her square spectacles at him but didnt say anything so er dyou think it would be all right mean will it be okay if i if i go to hogsmeade professor mcgonagall looked down and began shuffling papers on her desk im afraid not potter she said you heard what i said no form no visiting the village thats the rule but professor my aunt and uncle you know theyre muggles they dont really understand about about hogwarts forms and stuff harry said while ron egged him on with vigorous nods if you said i could go but i dont say so said professor mcgonagall standing up and piling her papers neatly into a drawer the form clearly states that the parent or guardian must give permission she turned to look at him with an odd expression on her face was it pity im sorry potter but thats my final word you had better hurry or youll be late for your next lesson there was nothing to be done ron called professor mcgonagall a lot of names that greatly annoyed hermione hermione assumed an allforthebest expression that made ron even angrier and harry had to endure everyone in the class talking loudly and happily about what they were going to do first once they got into hogsmeade theres always the feast said ron in an effort to cheer harry up you know the halloween feast in the evening yeah said harry gloomily great the halloween feast was always good but it would taste a lot better if he was coming to it after a day in hogsmeade with everyone else nothing anyone said made him feel any better about being left behind dean thomas who was good with a quill had offered to forge uncle vernons signature on the form but as harry had already told professor mcgonagall he hadnt had it signed that was no good ron halfheartedly suggested the invisibility cloak but hermione stamped on that one reminding ron what dumbledore had told them about the dementors being able to see through them percy had what were possibly the least helpful words of comfort they make a fuss about hogsmeade but i assure you harry its not all its cracked up to be he said seriously all right the sweetshops rather good and zonkos joke shops frankly dangerous and yes the shrieking shacks always worth a visit but really harry apart from that youre not missing anything on halloween morning harry awoke with the rest and went down to breakfast feeling thoroughly depressed though doing his best to act normally well bring you lots of sweets back from honeydukes said hermione looking desperately sorry for him yeah loads said ron he and hermione had finally forgotten their squabble about crookshanks in the face of harrys difficulties dont worry about me said harry in what he hoped was at offhand voice ill see you at the feast have a good time he accompanied them to the entrance hall where filch the caretaker was standing inside the front doors checking off names against a long list peering suspiciously into every face and making sure that no one was sneaking out who shouldnt be going staying here potter shouted malfoy who was standing in line with crabbe and goyle scared of passing the dementors harry ignored him and made his solitary way up the marble staircase through the deserted corridors and back to gryffindor tower password said the fat lady jerking out of a doze fortuna major said harry listlessly the portrait swung open and he climbed through the hole into the common room it was full of chattering first and second years and a few older students who had obviously visited hogsmeade so often the novelty had worn off harry harry hi harry it was colin creevey a second year who was deeply in awe of harry and never missed an opportunity to speak to him arent you going to hogsmeade harry why not hey colin looked eagerly around at his friends you can come and sit with us if you like harry er no thanks colin said harry who wasnt in the mood to have a lot of people staring avidly at the scar on his forehead i ive got to go to the library got to get some work done after that he had no choice but to turn right around and head back out of the portrait hole again what was the point waking me up the fat lady called grumpily after him as he walked away harry wandered dispiritedly toward the library but halfway there he changed his mind he didnt feel like working he turned around and came facetoface with filch who had obviously just seen off the last of the hogsmeade visitors what are you doing filch snarled suspiciously nothing said harry truthfully nothing spat filch his jowls quivering unpleasantly a likely story sneaking around on your own why arent you in hogsmeade buying stink pellets and belch powder and whizzing worms like the rest of your nasty little friends harry shrugged well get back to your common room where you belong snapped filch and he stood glaring until harry had passed out of sight but harry didnt go back to the common room he climbed a staircase thinking vaguely of visiting the owlery to see hedwig and was walking along another corridor when a voice from inside one of the rooms said harry harry doubled back to see who had spoken and met professor lupin looking around his office door what are you doing said lupin though in a very different voice from filch where are ron and hermione hogsmeade said harry in a wouldbe casual voice ah said lupin he considered harry for a moment why dont you come in ive just taken delivery of a grindylow for our next lesson a what said harry he followed lupin into his office in the corner stood a very large tank of water a sickly green creature with sharp little horns had its face pressed against the glass pulling faces and flexing its long spindly fingers water demon said lupin surveying the grindylow thoughtfully we shouldnt have much difficulty with him not after the kappas the trick is to break his grip you notice the abnormally long fingers strong but very brittle the grindylow bared its green teeth and then buried itself in a tangle of weeds in a corner cup of tea lupin said looking around for his kettle i was just thinking of making one all right said harry awkwardly lupin tapped the kettle with his wand and a blast of steam issued suddenly from the spout sit down said lupin taking the lid off a dusty tin ive only got teabags im afraid but i daresay youve had enough of tea leaves harry looked at him lupins eyes were twinkling how did you know about that harry asked professor mcgonagall told me said lupin passing harry a chipped mug of tea youre not worried are you no said harry he thought for a moment of telling lupin about the dog hed seen in magnolia crescent but decided not to he didnt want lupin to think he was a coward especially since lupin already seemed to think he couldnt cope with a boggart something of harrys thoughts seemed to have shown on his face because lupin said anything worrying you harry no harry lied he drank a bit of tea and watched the grindylow brandishing a fist at him yes he said suddenly putting his tea down on lupins desk you know that day we fought the boggart yes said lupin slowly why didnt you let me fight it said harry abruptly lupin raised his eyebrows i would have thought that was obvious harry he said sounding surprised harry who had expected lupin to deny that hed done any such thing was taken aback why he said again well said lupin frowning slightly i assumed that if the boggart faced you it would assume the shape of lord voldemort harry stared not only was this the last answer hed expected but lupin had said voldemorts name the only person harry had ever heard say the name aloud apart from himself was professor dumbledore clearly i was wrong said lupin still frowning at harry but i didnt think it a good idea for lord voldemort to materialize in the staffroom i imagined that people would panic i didnt think of voldemort said harry honestly i i remembered those dementors i see said lupin thoughtfully well well im impressed he smiled slightly at the look of surprise on harrys face that suggests that what you fear most of all is fear very wise harry harry didnt know what to say to that so he drank some more tea so youve been thinking that i didnt believe you capable of fighting the boggart said lupin shrewdly well yeah said harry he was suddenly feeling a lot happier professor lupin you know the dementors he was interrupted by a knock on the door come in called lupin the door opened and in came snape he was carrying a goblet which was smoking faintly and stopped at the sight of harry his black eyes narrowing ah severus said lupin smiling thanks very much could you leave it here on the desk for me snape set down the smoking goblet his eyes wandering between harry and lupin i was just showing harry my grindylow said lupin pleasantly pointing at the tank fascinating said snape without looking at it you should drink that directly lupin yes yes i will said lupin i made an entire cauldronful snape continued if you need more i should probably take some again tomorrow thanks very much severus not at all said snape but there was a look in his eye harry didnt like he backed out of the room unsmiling and watchful harry looked curiously at the goblet lupin smiled professor snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me he said i have never been much of a potionbrewer and this one is particularly complex he picked up the goblet and sniffed it pity sugar makes it useless he added taking a sip and shuddering why harry began lupin looked at him and answered the unfinished question ive been feeling a bit offcolor he said this potion is the only thing that helps i am very lucky to be working alongside professor snape there arent many wizards who are up to making it professor lupin took another sip and harry had a crazy urge to knock the goblet out of his hands professor snapes very interested in the dark arts he blurted out really said lupin looking only mildly interested as he took another gulp of potion some people reckon harry hesitated then plunged recklessly on some people reckon hed do anything to get the defense against the dark arts job lupin drained the goblet and pulled a face disgusting he said well harry id better get back to work see you at the feast later right said harry putting down his empty teacup the empty goblet was still smoking there you go said ron we got as much as we could carry a shower of brilliantly colored sweets fell into harrys lap it was dusk and ron and hermione had just turned up in the common room pinkfaced from the cold wind and looking as though theyd had the time of their lives thanks said harry picking up a packet of tiny black pepper imps whats hogsmeade like where did you go by the sound of it everywhere dervish and banges the wizarding equipment shop zonkos joke shop into the three broomsticks for foaming mugs of hot butterbeer and many places besides the post office harry about two hundred owls all sitting on shelves all colorcoded depending on how fast you want your letter to get there honeydukes has got a new kind of fudge they were giving out free samples theres a bit look we think we saw an ogre honestly they get all sorts at the three broomsticks wish we could have brought you some butterbeer really warms you up what did you do said hermione looking anxious did you get any work done no said harry lupin made me a cup of tea in his office and then snape came in he told them all about the goblet rons mouth fell open lupin drank it he gasped is he mad hermione checked her watch wed better go down you know the feastll be starting in five minutes they hurried through the portrait hole and into the crowd still discussing snape but if he you know hermione dropped her voice glancing nervously around if he was trying to to poison lupin he wouldnt have done it in front of harry yeah maybe said harry as they reached the entrance hall and crossed into the great hall it had been decorated with hundreds and hundreds of candlefilled pumpkins a cloud of fluttering live bats and many flaming orange streamers which were swimming lazily across the stormy ceiling like brilliant watersnakes the food was delicious even hermione and ron who were full to bursting with honeydukes sweets managed second helpings of everything harry kept glancing at the staff table professor lupin looked cheerful and as well as he ever did he was talking animatedly to tiny little professor flitwick the charms teacher harry moved his eyes along the table to the place where snape sat was he imagining it or were snapes eyes flickering toward lupin more often than was natural the feast finished with an entertainment provided by the hogwarts ghosts they popped out of the walls and tables to do a bit of formation gliding nearly headless nick the gryffindor ghost had a great success with a reenactment of his own botched beheading it had been such a pleasant evening that harrys good mood couldnt even be spoiled by malfoy who shouted through the crowd as they all left the hall the dementors send their love potter harry ron and hermione followed the rest of the gryffindors along the usual path to gryffindor tower but when they reached the corridor that ended with the portrait of the fat lady they found it jammed with students why isnt anyone going in said ron curiously harry peered over the heads in front of him the portrait seemed to be closed let me through please came percys voice and he came bustling importantly through the crowd whats the holdup here you cant all have forgotten the password excuse me im head boy and then a silence fell over the crowd from the front first so that a chill seemed to spread down the corridor they heard percy say in a suddenly sharp voice somebody get professor dumbledore quick peoples heads turned those at the back were standing on tiptoe whats going on said ginny who had just arrived a moment later professor dumbledore was there sweeping toward the portrait the gryffindors squeezed together to let him through and harry ron and hermione moved closer to see what the trouble was oh my hermione grabbed harrys arm the fat lady had vanished from her portrait which had been slashed so viciously that strips of canvas littered the floor great chunks of it had been torn away completely dumbledore took one quick look at the ruined painting and turned his eyes somber to see professors mcgonagall lupin and snape hurrying toward him we need to find her said dumbledore professor mcgonagall please go to mr filch at once and tell him to search every painting in the castle for the fat lady youll be lucky said a cackling voice it was peeves the poltergeist bobbing over the crowd and looking delighted as he always did at the sight of wreckage or worry what do you mean peeves said dumbledore calmly and peevess grin faded a little he didnt dare taunt dumbledore instead he adopted an oily voice that was no better than his cackle ashamed your headship sir doesnt want to be seen shes a horrible mess saw her running through the landscape up on the fourth floor sir dodging between the trees crying something dreadful he said happily poor thing he added unconvincingly did she say who did it said dumbledore quietly oh yes professorhead said peeves with the air of one cradling a large bombshell in his arms he got very angry when she wouldnt let him in you see peeves flipped over and grinned at dumbledore from between his own legs nasty temper hes got that sirius black chapter nine grim defeat professor dumbledore sent all the gryffindors back to the great hall where they were joined ten minutes later by the students from hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin who all looked extremely confused the teachers and i need to conduct a thorough search of the castle professor dumbledore told them as professors mcgonagall and flitwick closed all doors into the hall im afraid that for your own safety you will have to spend the night here i want the prefects to stand guard over the entrances to the hall and i am leaving the head boy and girl in charge any disturbance should be reported to me immediately he added to percy who was looking immensely proud and important send word with one of the ghosts professor dumbledore paused about to leave the hall and said oh yes youll be needing one casual wave of his wand and the long tables flew to the edges of the hall and stood themselves against the walls another wave and the floor was covered with hundreds of squashy purple sleeping bags sleep well said professor dumbledore closing the door behind him the hall immediately began to buzz excitedly the gryffindors were telling the rest of the school what had just happened everyone into their sleeping bags shouted percy come on now no more talking lights out in ten minutes cmon ron said to harry and hermione they seized three sleeping bags and dragged them into a corner do you think blacks still in the castle hermione whispered anxiously dumbledore obviously thinks he might be said ron its very lucky he picked tonight you know said hermione as they climbed fully dressed into their sleeping bags and propped themselves on their elbows to talk the one night we werent in the tower i reckon hes lost track of time being on the run said ron didnt realize it was halloween otherwise hed have come bursting in here hermione shuddered all around them people were asking one another the same question how did he get in maybe he knows how to apparate said a ravenclaw a few feet away just appear out of thin air you know disguised himself probably said a hufflepuff fifth year he couldve flown in suggested dean thomas honestly am i the only person whos ever bothered to read hogwarts a history said hermione crossly to harry and ron probably said ron why because the castles protected by more than walls you know said hermione there are all sorts of enchantments on it to stop people entering by stealth you cant just apparate in here and id like to see the disguise that could fool those dementors theyre guarding every single entrance to the grounds theyd have seen him fly in too and filch knows all the secret passages theyll have them covered the lights are going out now percy shouted i want everyone in their sleeping bags and no more talking the candles all went out at once the only light now came from the silvery ghosts who were drifting about talking seriously to the prefects and the enchanted ceiling which like the sky outside was scattered with stars what with that and the whispering that still filled the hall harry felt as though he were sleeping outdoors in a light wind once every hour a teacher would reappear in the hall to check that everything was quiet around three in the morning when many students had finally fallen asleep professor dumbledore came in harry watched him looking around for percy who had been prowling between the sleeping bags telling people off for talking percy was only a short way away from harry ron and hermlone who quickly pretended to be asleep as dumbledores footsteps drew nearer any sign of him professor asked percy in a whisper no all well here everything under control sir good theres no point moving them all now ive found a temporary guardian for the gryffindor portrait hole youll be able to move them back in tomorrow and the fat lady sir hiding in a map of argyllshire on the second floor apparently she refused to let black in without the password so he attacked shes still very distressed but once shes calmed down ill have mr filch restore her harry heard the door of the hall creak open again and more footsteps headmaster it was snape harry kept quite still listening hard the whole of the third floor has been searched hes not there and filch has done the dungeons nothing there either what about the astronomy tower professor trelawneys room the owlery all searched very well severus i didnt really expect black to linger have you any theory as to how he got in professor asked snape harry raised his head very slightly off his arms to free his other ear many severus each of them as unlikely as the next harry opened his eyes a fraction and squinted up to where they stood dumbledores back was to him but he could see percys face rapt with attention and snapes profile which looked angry you remember the conversation we had headmaster just before ah the start of term said snape who was barely opening his lips as though trying to block percy out of the conversation i do severus said dumbledore and there was something like warning in his voice it seems almost impossible that black could have entered the school without inside help i did express my concerns whet you appointed i do not believe a single person inside this castle would have helped black enter it said dumbledore and his tone made it so clear that the subject was closed that snape didnt reply i must go down to the dementors said dumbledore i said i would inform them when our search was complete didnt they want to help sir said percy oh yes said dumbledore coldly but im afraid no dementor will cross the threshold of this castle while i am headmaster percy looked slightly abashed dumbledore left the hall walking quickly and quietly snape stood for a moment watching the headmaster with an expression of deep resentment on his face then he too left harry glanced sideways at ron and hermione both of them had their eyes open too reflecting the starry ceiling what was all that about ron mouthed the school talked of nothing but sirius black for the next few days the theories about how he had entered the castle became wilder and wilder hannah abbott from hufflepuff spent much of their next herbology class telling anyone whod listen that black could turn into a flowering shrub the fat ladys ripped canvas had been taken off the wall and replaced with the portrait of sir cadogan and his fat gray pony nobody was very happy about this sir cadogan spent half his time challenging people to duels and the rest thinking up ridiculously complicated passwords which he changed at least twice a day hes a complete lunatic said seamus finnigan angrily to percy cant we get anyone else none of the other pictures wanted the job said percy frightened of what happened to the fat lady sir cadogan was the only one brave enough to volunteer sir cadogan however was the least of harrys worries he was now being closely watched teachers found excuses to walk along corridors with him and percy weasley acting harry suspected on his mothers orders was tailing him everywhere like an extremely pompous guard dog to cap it all professor mcgonagall summoned harry into her office with such a somber expression on her face harry thought someone must have died theres no point hiding it from you any longer potter she said in a very serious voice i know this will come as a shock to you but sirius black i know hes after me said harry wearily i heard rons dad telling his mum mr weasley works for the ministry of magic professor mcgonagall seemed very taken aback she stared at harry for a moment or two then said i see well in that case potter youll understand why i dont think its a good idea for you to be practicing quidditch in the evenings out on the field with only your team members its very exposed potter weve got our first match on saturday said harry outraged ive got to train professor professor mcgonagall considered him intently harry knew she was deeply interested in the gryffindor teams prospects it had been she after all whod suggested him as seeker in the first place he waited holding his breath hmm professor mcgonagall stood up and stared out of the window at the quidditch field just visible through the rain well goodness knows id like to see us win the cup at last but all the same potter id be happier if a teacher were present ill ask madam hooch to oversee your training sessions the weather worsened steadily as the first quidditch match drew nearer undaunted the gryffindor team was training harder than ever under the eye of madam hooch then at their final training session before saturdays match oliver wood gave his team some unwelcome news were not playing slytherin he told them looking very angry flints just been to see me were playing hufflepuff instead why chorused the rest of the team flints excuse is that their seekers arms still injured said wood grinding his teeth furiously but its obvious why theyre doing it dont want to play in this weather think itll damage their chances there had been strong winds and heavy rain all day and as wood spoke they heard a distant rumble of thunder theres nothing wrong with malfoys arm said harry furiously hes faking it i know that but we cant prove it said wood bitterly and weve been practicing all those moves assuming were playing slytherin and instead its hufflepuff and their styles quite different theyve got a new captain and seeker cedric diggory angelina alicia and katie suddenly giggled what said wood frowning at this lighthearted behavior hes that tall goodlooking one isnt he said angelina strong and silent said katie and they started to giggle again hes only silent because hes too thick to string two words together said fred impatiently i dont know why youre worried oliver hufflepuff is a pushover last time we played them harry caught the snitch in about five minutes remember we were playing in completely different conditions wood shouted his eyes bulging slightly diggorys put a very strong side together hes an excellent seeker i was afraid youd take it like this we mustnt relax we must keep our focus slytherin is trying to wrongfoot us we must win oliver calm down said fred looking slightly alarmed were taking hufflepuff very seriously seriously the day before the match the winds reached howling point and the rain fell harder than ever it was so dark inside the corridors and classrooms that extra torches and lanterns were lit the slytherin team was looking very smug indeed and none more so than malfoy ah if only my arm was feeling a bit better he sighed as the gale outside pounded the windows harry had no room in his head to worry about anything except the match tomorrow oliver wood kept hurrying up to him between classes and giving him tips the third time this happened wood talked for so long that harry suddenly realized he was ten minutes late for defense against the dark arts and set off at a run with wood shouting after him diggorys got a very fast swerve harry so you might want to try looping him harry skidded to a halt outside the defense against the dark arts classroom pulled the door open and dashed inside sorry im late professor lupin i but it wasnt professor lupin who looked up at him from the teachers desk it was snape this lesson began ten minutes ago potter so i think well make it ten points from gryffindor sit down but harry didnt move wheres professor lupin he said he says he is feeling too ill to teach today said snape with a twisted smile i believe i told you to sit down but harry stayed where he was whats wrong with him snapes black eyes glittered nothing lifethreatening he said looking as though he wished it were five more points from gryffindor and if i have to ask you to sit down again it will be fifty harry walked slowly to his seat and sat down snape looked around at the class as i was saying before potter interrupted professor lupin has not left any record of the topics you have covered so far please sir weve done boggarts red caps kappas and grindylows said hermione quickly and were just about to start be quiet said snape coldly i did not ask for information i was merely commenting on professor lupins lack of organization hes the best defense against the dark arts teacher weve ever had said dean thomas boldly and there was a murmur of agreement from the rest of the class snape looked more menacing than ever you are easily satisfied lupin is hardly overtaxing you i would expect first years to be able to deal with red caps and grindylows today we shall discuss harry watched him flick through the textbook to the very back chapter which he must know they hadnt covered werewolves said snape but sir said hermione seemingly unable to restrain herself were not supposed to do werewolves yet were due to start hinkypunks miss granger said snape in a voice of deadly calm i was under the impression that i am teaching this lesson not you and i am telling you all to turn to page 394 he glanced around again all of you now with many bitter sidelong looks and some sullen muttering the class opened their books which of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf and the true wolf said snape everyone sat in motionless silence everyone except hermione whose hand as it so often did had shot straight into the air anyone snape said ignoring hermione his twisted smile was back are you telling me that professor lupin hasnt even taught you the basic distinction between we told you said parvati suddenly we havent got as far as werewolves yet were still on silence snarled snape well well well i never thought id meet a thirdyear class who wouldnt even recognize a werewolf when they saw one i shall make a point of informing professor dumbledore how very behind you all are please sir said hermione whose hand was still in the air the werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways the snout of the werewolf that is the second time you have spoken out of turn miss granger said snape coolly five more points from gryffindor for being an insufferable knowitall hermione went very red put down her hand and stared at the floor with her eyes full of tears it was a mark of how much the class loathed snape that they were all glaring at him because every one of them had called hermione a knowitall at least once and ron who told hermione she was a knowitall at least twice a week said loudly you asked us a question and she knows the answer why ask if you dont want to be told the class knew instantly hed gone too far snape advanced on ron slowly and the room held its breath detention weasley snape said silkily his face very close to rons and if i ever hear you criticize the way i teach a class again you will be very sorry indeed no one made a sound throughout the rest of the lesson they sat and made notes on werewolves from the textbook while snape prowled up and down the rows of desks examining the work they had been doing with professor lupin very poorly explained that is incorrect the kappa is more commonly found in mongolia professor lupin gave this eight out of ten i wouldnt have given it three when the bell rang at last snape held them back you will each write an essay to be handed in to me on the ways you recognize and kill werewolves i want two rolls of parchment of the subject and i want them by monday morning it is time somebody took this class in hand weasley stay behind we need to arrange your detention harry and hermione left the room with the rest of the class who waited until they were well out of earshot then burst into a furious tirade about snape snapes never been like this with any of our other defense against the dark arts teachers even if he did want the job harry said to hermione whys he got it in for lupin dyou think this is all because of the boggart i dont know said hermione pensively but i really hope professor lupin gets better soon ron caught up with them five minutes later in a towering rage dyou know what that he called snape something that made hermione say ron is making me do ive got to scrub out the bedpans in the hospital wing without magic he was breathing deeply his fists clenched why couldnt black have hidden in snapes office eh he could have finished him off for us harry woke extremely early the next morning so early that it was till dark for a moment he thought the roaring of the wind had woken him then he felt a cold breeze on the back of his neck and sat bolt upright peeves the poltergeist had been floating next to him blowing hard in his ear what did you do that for said harry furiously peeves puffed out his cheeks blew hard and zoomed backward out of the room cackling harry fumbled for his alarm clock and looked at it it was half past four cursing peeves he rolled over and tried to get back to sleep but it was very difficult now that he was awake to ignore the sounds of the thunder rumbling overhead the pounding of the wind against the castle walls and the distant creaking of the trees in the forbidden forest in a few hours he would be out on the quidditch field battling through that gale finally he gave up any thought of more sleep got up dressed picked up his nimbus two thousand and walked quietly out of the dormitory as harry opened the door something brushed against his leg he bent down just in time to grab crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail and drag him outside you know i reckon ron was right about you harry told crookshanks suspiciously there are plenty of mice around this place go and chase them go on he added nudging crookshanks down the spiral staircase with his foot leave scabbers alone the noise of the storm was even louder in the common roorn harry knew better than to think the match would be canceled quidditch matches werent called off for trifles like thunderstorms nevertheless he was starting to feel very apprehensive wood had pointed out cedric diggory to him in the corridor diggory was a fifth year and a lot bigger than harry seekers were usually light and speedy but diggorys weight would be an advantage in this weather because he was less likely to be blown off course harry whiled away the hours until dawn in front of the fire getting up every now and then to stop crookshanks from sneaking up the boys staircase again at long last harry thought it must be time for breakfast so he headed through the portrait hole alone stand and fight you mangy cur yelled sir cadogan oh shut up harry yawned he revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge and by the time hed started on toast the rest of the team had turned up its going to be a tough one said wood who wasnt eating anything stop worrying oliver said alicia soothingly we dont mind a bit of rain but it was considerably more than a bit of rain such was the popularity of quidditch that the whole school turned out to watch the match as usual but they ran down the lawns toward the quidditch field heads bowed against the ferocious wind umbrellas being whipped out of their hands as they went just before he entered the locker room harry saw malfoy crabbe and goyle laughing and pointing at him from under an enormous umbrella on their way to the stadium the team changed into their scarlet robes and waited for woods usual prematch pep talk but it didnt come he tried to speak several times made an odd gulping noise then shook his head hopelessly and beckoned them to follow him the wind was so strong that they staggered sideways as they walked out onto the field if the crowd was cheering they couldnt hear it over the fresh rolls of thunder rain was splattering over harrys glasses how on earth was he going to see the snitch in this the hufflepuffs were approaching from the opposite side of the field wearing canaryyellow robes the captains walked up to each other and shook hands diggory smiled at wood but wood looked as though he had lockjaw and merely nodded harry saw madam hoochs mouth form the words mount your brooms he pulled his right foot out of the mud with a squelch and swung it over his nimbus two thousand madam hooch put her whistle to her lips and gave it a blast that sounded shrill and distant they were off harry rose fast but his nimbus was swerving slightly with the wind he held it as steady as he could and turned squinting into the rain within five minutes harry was soaked to his skin and frozen hardly able to see his teammates let alone the tiny snitch he flew backward and forward across the field past blurred red and yellow shapes with no idea of what was happening in the rest of the game he couldnt hear the commentary over the wind the crowd was hidden beneath a sea of cloaks and battered umbrellas twice harry came very close to being unseated by a bludger his vision was so clouded by the rain on his glasses he hadnt seen them coming he lost track of time it was getting harder and harder to hold his broom straight the sky was getting darker as though night had decided to come early twice harry nearly hit another player without knowing whether it was a teammate or opponent everyone was now so wet and the rain so thick he could hardly tell them apart with the first flash of lightning came the sound of madam hoochs whistle harry could just see the outline of wood through the thick rain gesturing him to the ground the whole team splashed down into the mud i called for timeout wood roared at his team come on under here they huddled at the edge of the field under a large umbrella harry took off his glasses and wiped them hurriedly on his robes whats the score were fifty points up said wood but unless we get the snitch soon well be playing into the night ive got no chance with these on harry said exasperatedly waving his glasses at that very moment hermione appeared at his shoulder she was holding her cloak over her head and was inexplicably beaming ive had an idea harry give me your glasses quick he handed them to her and as the team watched in amazement hermione tapped them with her wand and said impervius there she said handing them back to harry theyll repel water wood looked as though he could have kissed her brilliant he called hoarsely after her as she disappeared into the crowd okay team lets go for it hermiones spell had done the trick harry was still numb with cold still wetter than hed ever been in his life but he could see full of fresh determination he urged his broom through the turbulent air staring in every direction for the snitch avoiding a bludger ducking beneath diggory who was streaking in the opposite direction there was another clap of thunder followed immediately by forked lightning this was getting more and more dangerous harry needed to get the snitch quickly he turned intending to head back toward the middle of the field but at that moment another flash of lightning illuminated the stands and harry saw something that distracted him completely the silhouette of an enormous shaggy black dog clearly imprinted against the sky motionless in the topmost empty row of seats harrys numb hands slipped on the broom handle and his nimbus dropped a few feet shaking his sodden bangs out of his eyes he squinted back into the stands the dog had vanished harry came woods anguished yell from the gryffindor goal posts harry behind you harry looked wildly around cedric diggory was pelting up the field and a tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the rainfilled air between them with a jolt of panic harry threw himself flat to the broornhandle and zoomed toward the snitch come on he growled at his nimbus as the rain whipped his face faster but something odd was happening an eerie silence was falling across the stadium the wind though as strong as ever was forgetting to roar it was as though someone had turned off the sound as though harry had gone suddenly deaf what was going on and then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over him inside him just as he became aware of something moving on the field below before hed had time to think harry had taken his eyes off the snitch and looked down at least a hundred dementors their hidden faces pointing up at him were standing beneath him it was as though freezing water were rising in his chest cutting at his insides and then he heard it againsomeone was screaming screaming inside his head a woman not harry not harry please not harry stand aside you silly girl stand aside now not harry please no take me kill me instead numbing swirling white mist was filling harrys brain what was he doing why was he flying he needed to help her she was going to die she was going to be murdered he was falling falling through the icy mist not harry please have mercy have mercy a shrill voice was laughing the woman was screaming and harry knew no more lucky the ground was so soft i thought he was dead for sure but he didnt even break his glasses harry could hear the voices whispering but they made no sense whatsoever he didnt have a clue where he was or how hed got there or what hed been doing before he got there all he knew was that every inch of him was aching as though it had been beaten that was the scariest thing ive ever seen in my life scariest the scariest thing hooded black figures cold screaming harrys eyes snapped open he was lying in the hospital wing the gryffindor quidditch team spattered with mud from head to foot was gathered around his bed ron and hermione were also there looking as though theyd just climbed out of a swimming pool harry said fred who looked extremely white underneath the mud howre you feeling it was as though harrys memory was on fast forward the lightning the grim the snitch and the dementors what happened he said sitting up so suddenly they all gasped you fell off said fred mustve been what fifty feet we thought youd died said alicia who was shaking hermione made a small squeaky noise her eyes were extremely bloodshot but the match said harry what happened are we doing a replay no one said anything the horrible truth sank into harry like a stone we didnt lose diggory got the snitch said george just after you fell he didnt realize what had happened when he looked back and saw you on the ground he tried to call it off wanted a rematch but they won fair and square even wood admits it where is wood said harry suddenly realizing he wasnt there still in the showers said fred we think hes trying to drown himself harry put his face to his knees his hands gripping his hair fred grabbed his shoulder and shook it roughly cmon harry youve never missed the snitch before there had to be one time you didnt get it said george its not over yet said fred we lost by a hundred points right so if hufflepuff loses to ravenclaw and we beat ravenclaw and slytherin hufflepuffll have to lose by at least two hundred points said george but if they beat ravenclaw no way ravenclaw is too good but if slytherin loses against hufflepuff it all depends on the points a margin of a hundred either way harry lay there not saying a word they had lost for the first time ever he had lost a quidditch match after ten minutes or so madam pomfrey came over to tell the team to leave him in peace well come and see you later fred told him dont beat yourself up harry youre still the best seeker weve ever had the team trooped out trailing mud behind them madam pomfrey shut the door behind them looking disapproving ron and hermione moved nearer to harrys bed dumbledore was really angry hermione said in a quaking voice ive never seen him like that before he ran onto the field as you fell waved his wand and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground then he whirled his wand at the dementors shot silver stuff at them they left the stadium right away he was furious theyd come onto the grounds we heard him then he magicked you onto a stretcher said ron and walked up to school with you floating on it everyone thought you were his voice faded but harry hardly noticed he was thinking about what the dementors had done to him about the screaming voice he looked up and saw ron and hermione lookin at him so anxiously that he quickly cast around for something matteroffact to say did someone get my nimbus ron and hermione looked quickly at each other er what said harry looking from one to the other well when you fell off it got blown away said hermione hesitantly and and it hit it hit oh harry it hit the whomping willow harrys insides lurched the whomping willow was a very violent tree that stood alone in the middle of the grounds and he said dreading the answer well you know the whomping willow said ron it it doesnt like being hit professor flitwick brought it back just before you came around said hermione in a very small voice slowly she reached down for a bag at her feet turned it upside down and tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed the only remains of harrys faithful finally beaten broomstick chapter ten the marauders map madam pomfrey insisted on keeping harry in the hospital wing for the rest of the weekend he didnt argue or complain but he wouldnt let her throw away the shattered remnants of his nimbus two thousand he knew he was being stupid knew that the nimbus was beyond repair but harry couldnt help it he felt as though hed lost one of his best friends he had a stream of visitors all intent on cheering him up hagrid sent him a bunch of earwiggy flowers that looked like yellow cabbages and ginny weasley blushing furiously turned up with a getwell card she had made herself which sang shrilly unless harry kept it shut under his bowl of fruit the gryffindor team visited again on sunday morning this time accompanied by wood who told harry in a hollow dead sort of voice that he didnt blame him in the slightest ron and hermione left harrys bedside only at night but nothing anyone said or did could make harry feel any better because they knew only half of what was troubling him he hadnt told anyone about the grim not even ron and hermione because he knew ron would panic and hermione would scoff the fact remained however that it had now appeared twice and both appearances had been followed by nearfatal accidents the first time he had nearly been run over by the knight bus the second fallen fifty feet from his broomstick was the grim going to haunt him until he actually died was he going to spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder for the beast and then there were the dementors harry felt sick and humiliated every time he thought of them everyone said the dementors were horrible but no one else collapsed every time they went near one no one else heard echoes in their head of their dying parents because harry knew who that screaming voice belonged to now he had heard her words heard them over and over again during the night hours in the hospital wing while he lay awake staring at the strips of moonlight on the ceiling when the dementors approached him he heard the last moments of his mothers life her attempts to protect him harry from lord voldemort and voldemorts laughter before he murdered her harry dozed fitfully sinking into dreams full of clammy rotted hands and petrified pleading jerking awake to dwell again on his mothers voice it was a relief to return to the noise and bustle of the main school on monday where he was forced to think about other things even if he had to endure draco malfoys taunting malfoy was almost beside himself with glee at gryffindors defeat he had finally taken off his bandages and celebrated having the full use of both arms again by doing spirited imitations of harry falling off his broom malfoy spent much of their next potions class doing dementor imitations across the dungeon ron finally cracked and flung a large slippery crocodile heart at malfoy which hit him in the face and caused snape to take fifty points from gryffindor if snapes teaching defense against the dark arts again im skiving off said ron as they headed toward lupins classroom after lunch check whos in there hermione hermione peered around the classroom door its okay professor lupin was back at work it certainly looked as though he had been ill his old robes were hanging more loosely on him and there were dark shadows beneath his eyes nevertheless he smiled at the class as they took their seats and they burst at once into an explosion of complaints about snapes behavior while lupin had been ill its not fair he was only filling in why should he give us homework we dont know anything about werewolves two rolls of parchment did you tell professor snape we havent covered them yet lupin asked frowning slightly the babble broke out again yes but he said we were really behind he wouldnt listen two rolls of parchment professor lupin smiled at the look of indignation on every face dont worry ill speak to professor snape you dont have to do the essay oh no said hermione looking very disappointed ive already finished it they had a very enjoyable lesson professor lupin had brought along a glass box containing a hinkypunk a little onelegged creature who looked as though he were made of wisps of smoke rather frail and harmless looking lures travelers into bogs said professor lupin as they took notes you notice the lantern dangling from his hand hops ahead people follow the light then the hinkypunk made a horrible squelching noise against the glass when the bell rang everyone gathered up their things and headed for the door harry among them but wait a moment harry lupin called id like a word harry doubled back and watched professor lupin covering the hinkypunks box with a cloth i heard about the match said lupin turning back to his desk and starting to pile books into his briefcase and im sorry about your broomstick is there any chance of fixing it no said harry the tree smashed it to bits lupin sighed they planted the whomping willow the same year that i arrived at hogwarts people used to play a game trying to get near enough to touch the trunk in the end a boy called davey gudgeon nearly lost an eye and we were forbidden to go near it no broomstick would have a chance did you hear about the dementors too said harry with difficulty lupin looked at him quickly yes i did i dont think any of us have seen professor dumbledore that angry they have been growing restless for some time furious at his refusal to let them inside the grounds i suppose they were the reason you fell yes said harry he hesitated and then the question he had to ask burst from him before he could stop himself why why do they affect me like that am i just it has nothing to do with weakness said professor lupin sharply as though he had read harrys mind the dementors affect you worse than the others because there are horrors in your past that the others dont have a ray of wintery sunlight fell across the classroom illuminating lupins gray hairs and the lines on his young face dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth they infest the darkest filthiest places they glory in decay and despair they drain peace hope and happiness out of the air around them even muggles feel their presence though they cant see them get too near a dementor and every good feeling every happy memory will be sucked out of you if it can the dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself soulless and evil youll be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life and the worst that happened to you harry is enough to make anyone fall off their broom you have nothing to feel ashamed of when they get near me harry stared at lupins desk his throat tight i can hear voldemort murdering my mum lupin made a sudden motion with his arm as though to grip harrys shoulder but thought better of it there was a moments silence then why did they have to come to the match said harry bitterly theyre getting hungry said lupin coolly shutting his briefcase with a snap dumbledore wont let them into the school so their supply of human prey has dried up i dont think they could resist the large crowd around the quidditch field all that excitement emotions running high it was their idea of a feast azkaban must be terrible harry muttered lupin nodded grimly the fortress is set on a tiny island way out to sea but they dont need walls and water to keep the prisoners in not when theyre all trapped inside their own heads incapable of a single cheery thought most of them go mad within weeks but sirius black escaped from them harry said slowly he got away lupins briefcase slipped from the desk he had to stoop quickly to catch it yes he said straightening up black must have found a way to fight them i wouldnt have believed it possible dementors are supposed to drain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them too long you made that dementor on the train back off said harry suddenly there are certain defenses one can use said lupin but there was only one dementor on the train the more there are the more difficult it becomes to resist what defenses said harry at once can you teach me i dont pretend to be an expert at fighting dementors harry quite the contrary but if the dementors come to another quidditch match i need to be able to fight them lupin looked into harrys determined face hesitated then said well all right ill try and help but itll have to wait until next term im afraid i have a lot to do before the holidays i chose a very inconvenient time to fall ill what with the promise of antidementor lessons from lupin the thought that he might never have to hear his mothers death again and the fact that ravenclaw flattened hufflepuff in their quidditch match at the end of november harrys mood took a definite upturn gryffindor were not out of the running after all although they could not afford to lose another match wood became repossessed of his manic energy and worked his team as hard as ever in the chilly haze of rain that persisted into december harry saw no hint of a dementor within the grounds dumbledores anger seemed to be keeping them at their stations at the entrances two weeks before the end of the term the sky lightened suddenly to a dazzling opaline white and the muddy grounds were revealed one morning covered in glittering frost inside the castle there was a buzz of christmas in the air professor flitwick the charms teacher had already decorated his classroom with shimmering lights that turned out to be real fluttering fairies the students were all happily discussing their plans for the holidays both ron and hermione had decided to remain at hogwarts and though ron said it was because he couldnt stand two weeks with percy and hermione insisted she needed to use the library harry wasnt fooled they were doing it to keep him company and he was very grateful to everyones delight except harrys there was to be another hogsmeade trip on the very last weekend of the term we can do all our christmas shopping there said hermione mum and dad would really love those toothflossing stringmints from honeydukes resigned to the fact that he would be the only third year staying behind again harry borrowed a copy of which broomstick from wood and decided to spend the day reading up on the different makes he had been riding one of the school brooms at team practice an ancient shooting star which was very slow and jerky he definitely needed a new broom of his own on the saturday morning of the hogsmeade trip harry bid goodbye to ron and hermione who were wrapped in cloaks and scarves then turned up the marble staircase alone and headed back toward gryffindor tower snow had started to fall outside the windows and the castle was very still and quiet psst harry he turned halfway along the thirdfloor corridor to see fred and george peering out at him from behind a statue of a humpbacked oneeyed witch what are you doing said harry curiously how come youre not going to hogsmeade weve come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go said fred with a mysterious wink come in here he nodded toward an empty classroom to the left of the oneeyed statue harry followed fred and george inside george closed the door quietly and then turned beaming to look at harry early christmas present for you harry he said fred pulled something from inside his cloak with a flourish and laid it on one of the desks it was a large square very worn piece of parchment with nothing written on it harry suspecting one of fred and georges jokes stared at it whats that supposed to be this harry is the secret of our success said george patting the parchment fondly its a wrench giving it to you said fred but we decided last night your needs greater than ours anyway we know it by heart said george we bequeath it to you we dont really need it anymore and what do i need with a bit of old parchment said harry a bit of old parchment said fred closing his eyes with a grimace as though harry had mortally offended him explain george well when we were in our first year harry young carefree and innocent harry snorted he doubted whether fred and george had ever been innocent well more innocent than we are now we got into a spot of bother with filch we let off a dungbomb in the corridor and it upset him for some reason so he hauled us off to his office and started threatening us with the usual detention disembowelment and we couldnt help noticing a drawer in one of his filing cabinets marked confiscated and highly dangerous dont tell me said harry starting to grin well what would youve done said fred george caused a diversion by dropping another dungbomb i whipped the drawer open and grabbed this its not as bad as it sounds you know said george we dont reckon filch ever found out how to work it he probably suspected what it was though or he wouldnt have confiscated it and you know how to work it oh yes said fred smirking this little beautys taught us more than all the teachers in this school youre winding me up said harry looking at the ragged old bit of parchment oh are we said george he took out his wand touched the parchment lightly and said i solemnly swear that i am up to no good and at once thin ink lines began to spread like a spiders web from the point that georges wand had touched they joined each other they crisscrossed they fanned into every corner of the parchment then words began to blossom across the top great curly green words that proclaimed masters moony wormtail padfoot and prongs purveyors of aids to magical mischiefmakers are proud to present the marauders map it was a map showing every detail of the hogwarts castle and grounds but the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it each labeled with a name in minuscule writing astounded harry bent over it a labeled dot in the top left corner showed that professor dumbledore was pacing his study the caretakers cat mrs norris was prowling the second floor and peeves the poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy room and as harrys eyes traveled up and down the familiar corridors he noticed something else this map showed a set of passages he had never entered and many of them seemed to lead right into hogsmeade said fred tracing one of them with his finger there are seven in all now filch knows about these four he pointed them out but were sure were the only ones who know about these dont bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor we used it until last winter but its caved in completely blocked and we dont reckon anyones ever used this one because the whomping willows planted right over the entrance but this one here this one leads right into the cellar of honeydukes weve used it loads of times and as you mightve noticed the entrance is right outside this room through that oneeyed old crones hump moony wormtaill padfoot and prongs sighed george patting the heading of the map we owe them so much noble men working tirelessly to help a new generation of lawbreakers said fred solemnly right said george briskly dont forget to wipe it after youve used it or anyone can read it fred said warningly just tap it again and say mischief managed and itll go blank so young harry said fred in an uncanny impersonation of percy mind you behave yourself see you in honeydukes said george winking they left the room both smirking in a satisfied sort of way harry stood there gazing at the miraculous map he watched the tiny ink mrs norris turn left and pause to sniff at something on the floor if filch really didnt know he wouldnt have to pass the dementors at all but even as he stood there flooded with excitement something harry had once heard mr weasley say came floating out of his memory never trust anything that can think for itself if you cant see where it keeps its brain this map was one of those dangerous magical objects mr weasley had been warning against aids for magical mischief makers but then harry reasoned he only wanted to use it to get into hogsmeade it wasnt as though he wanted to steal anything or attack anyone and fred and george had been using it for years without anything horrible happening harry traced the secret passage to honeydukes with his finger then quite suddenly as though following orders he rolled up the map stuffed it inside his robes and hurried to the door of the classroom he opened it a couple of inches there was no one outside very carefully he edged out of the room and behind the statue of the oneeyed witch what did he have to do he pulled out the map again and saw to his astonishment that a new ink figure had appeared upon it labeled harry potter this figure was standing exactly where the real harry was standing about halfway down the thirdfloor corridor harry watched carefully his little ink self appeared to be tapping the witch with his minute wand harry quickly took out his real wand and tapped the statue nothing happened he looked back at the map the tiniest speech bubble had appeared next to his figure the word inside said dissendium dissendium harry whispered tapping the stone witch again at once the statues hump opened wide enough to admit a fairly thin person harry glanced quickly up and down the corridor then tucked the map away again hoisted himself into the hole headfirst and pushed himself forward he slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide then landed on cold damp earth he stood up looking around it was pitch dark he held up his wand muttered lumos and saw that he was in a very narrow low earthy passageway he raised the map tapped it with the tip of his wand and muttered mischief managed the map went blank at once he folded it carefully tucked it inside his robes then heart beating fast both excited and apprehensive he set off the passage twisted and turned more like the burrow of a giant rabbit than anything else harry hurried along it stumbling now and then on the uneven floor holding his wand out in front of him it took ages but harry had the thought of honeydukes to sustain him after what felt like an hour the passage began to rise panting harry sped up his face hot his feet very cold ten minutes later he came to the foot of some worn stone steps which rose out of sight above him careful not to make any noise harry began to climb a hundred steps two hundred steps he lost count as he climbed watching his feet then without warning his head hit something hard it seemed to be a trapdoor harry stood there massaging the top of his head listening he couldnt hear any sounds above him very slowly he pushed the trapdoor open and peered over the edge he was in a cellar which was full of wooden crates and boxes harry climbed out of the trapdoor and replaced it it blended so perfectly with the dusty floor that it was impossible to tell it was there harry crept slowly toward the wooden staircase that led upstairs now he could definitely hear voices not to mention the tinkle of a bell and the opening and shutting of a door wondering what he ought to do he suddenly heard a door open much closer at hand somebody was about to come downstairs and get another box of jelly slugs dear theyve nearly cleaned us out said a womans voice a pair of feet was coming down the staircase harry leapt behind an enormous crate and waited for the footsteps to pass he heard the man shifting boxes against the opposite wall he might not get another chance quickly and silently harry dodged out from his hiding place and climbed the stairs looking back he saw an enormous backside and shiny bald head buried in a box harry reached the door at the top of the stairs slipped through it and found himself behind the counter of honeydukes he ducked crept sideways and then straightened up honeydukes was so crowded with hogwarts students that no one looked twice at harry he edged among them looking around and suppressed a laugh as he imagined the look that would spread over dudleys piggy face if he could see where harry was now there were shelves upon shelves of the most succulentlooking sweets imaginable creamy chunks of nougat shimmering pink squares of coconut ice fat honeycolored toffees hundreds of different kinds of chocolate in neat rows there was a large barrel of every flavor beans and another of fizzing whizbees the levitating sherbert balls that ron had mentioned along yet another wall were special effects sweets droobles best blowing gum which filled a room with bluebellcolored bubbles that refused to pop for days the strange splintery toothflossing stringmints tiny black pepper imps breathe fire for your friends ice mice hear your teeth chatter and squeak peppermint creams shaped like toads hop realistically in the stomach fragile sugarspun quills and exploding bonbons harry squeezed himself through a crowd of sixth years and saw a sign hanging in the farthest corner of the shop unusual tastes ron and hermione were standing underneath it examining a tray of bloodflavored lollipops harry sneaked up behind them ugh no harry wont want one of those theyre for vampires i expect hermione was saying how about these said ron shoving a jar of cockroach clusters under hermiones nose definitely not said harry ron nearly dropped the jar harry squealed hermione what are you doing here how how did you wow said ron looking very impressed youve learned to apparate course i havent said harry he dropped his voice so that none of the sixth years could hear him and told them all about the marauders map how come fred and george never gave it to me said ron outraged im their brother but harry isnt going to keep it said hermione as though the idea were ludicrous hes going to hand it in to professor mcgonagall arent you harry no im not said harry are you mad said ron goggling at hermione hand in something that good if i hand it in ill have to say where i got it filch would know fred and george had nicked it but what about sirius black hermione hissed he could be using one of the passages on that map to get into the castle the teachers have got to know he cant be getting in through a passage said harry quickly there are seven secret tunnels on the map right fred and george reckon filch already knows about four of them and of the other three one of thems caved in so no one can get through it one of thems got the whomping willow planted over the entrance so you cant get out of it and the one i just came through well its really hard to see the entrance to it down in the cellar so unless he knew it was there harry hesistated what if black did know the passage was there ron however cleared his throat significantly and pointed to a notice pasted on the inside of the sweetshop door by order of the ministry of magic customers are reminded that until further notice dementors will be patrolling the streets of hogsmeade every night after sundown this measure has been put in place for the safety of hogsmeade residents and will be lifted upon the recapture of sirius black it is therefore advisable that you complete your shopping well before nightfall merry christmas see said ron quietly id like to see black try and break into honeydukes with dementors swarming all over the village anyway hermione the honeydukes owners would hear a breakin wouldnt they they live over the shop yes but but hermoine seemed to be struggling to find another problem look harry still shouldnt be coming into hogsmeade he hasnt got a signed form if anyone finds out hell be in so much trouble and its not nightfall yet what if sirius black turns up today now hed have a job spotting harry in this said ron nodding through the mullioned windows at the thick swirling snow come on hermione its christmas harry deserves a break hermione bit her lip looking extremely worried are you going to report me harry asked her grinning oh of course not but honestly harry seen the fizzing whizbees harry said ron grabbing him and leading him over to their barrel and the jelly slugs and the acid pops fred gave me one of those when i was seven it burnt a hole right through my tongue i remember mum walloping him with her broomstick ron stared broodingly into the acid pop box reckon fredd take a bit of cockroach cluster if i told him they were peanuts when ron and hermione had paid for all their sweets the three of them left honeydukes for the blizzard outside hogsmeade looked like a christmas card the little thatched cottages and shops were all covered in a layer of crisp snow there were holly wreaths on the doors and strings of enchanted candles hanging in the trees harry shivered unlike the other two he didnt have his cloak they headed up the street heads bowed against the wind ron and hermione shouting through their scarves thats the post office zonkos is up there we could go up to the shrieking shack tell you what said ron his teeth chattering shall we go for a butterbeer in the three broomsticks harry was more than willing the wind was fierce and his hands were freezing so they crossed the road and in a few minutes were entering the tiny inn it was extremely crowded noisy warm and smoky a curvy sort of woman with a pretty face was serving a bunch of rowdy warlock up at the bar thats madam rosmerta said ron ill get the drinks shall i he added going slightly red harry and hermione made their way to the back of the room there was a small vacant table between the window and a handsome christmas tree which stood next to the fireplace ron came back five minutes later carrying three foaming tankards of hot butterbeer merry christmas he said happily raising his tankard harry drank deeply it was the most delicious thing hed ever tasted and seemed to heat every bit of him from the inside a sudden breeze ruffled his hair the door of the three broomsticks had opened again harry looked over the rim of his tankard and choked professors mcgonagall and flitwick had just entered the pub with a flurry of snowflakes shortly followed by hagrid who was deep in conversation with a portly man in a limegreen bowler hat and a pinstriped cloak cornelius fudge minister of magic in an instant ron and hermione had both placed hands on the top of harrys head and forced him off his stool and under the table dripping with butterbeer and crouching out of sight harry clutched his empty tankard and watched the teachers and fudges feet move toward the bar pause then turn and walk right toward him somewhere above him hermione whispered mobiliarbus the christmas tree beside their table rose a few inches off the ground drifted sideways and landed with a soft thump right in front of their table hiding them from view staring through the dense lower branches harry saw four sets of chair legs move back from the table right beside theirs then heard the grunts and sighs of the teachers and minister as they sat down next he saw another pair of feet wearing sparkly turquoise high heels and heard a womans voice a small gillywater mine said professor mcgonagalls voice four pints of mulled mead ah rosmerta said hagrid a cherry syrup and soda with ice and umbrella mmm said professor flitwick smacking his lips so youll be the red currant rum minister thank you rosmerta mdear said fudges voice lovely to see you again i must say have one yourself wont you come and join us well thank you very much minister harry watched the glittering heels march away and back again his heart was pounding uncomfortably in his throat why hadnt it occurred to him that this was the last weekend of term for the teachers too and how long were they going to sit there he needed time to sneak back into honeydukes if he wanted to return to school tonight hermiones leg gave a nervous twitch next to him so what brings you to this neck of the woods minister came madam rosmertas voice harry saw the lower part of fudges thick body twist in his chair as though he were checking for eavesdroppers then he said in a quiet voice what else mdear but sirius black i daresay you heard what happened up at the school at halloween i did hear a rumor admitted madam rosmerta did you tell the whole pub hagrid said professor mcgonagall exasperatedly do you think blacks still in the area minister whispered madam rosmerta im sure of it said fudge shortly you know that the dementors have searched the whole village twice said madam rosmerta a slight edge to her voice scared all my customers away its very bad for business minister rosmerta dear i dont like them any more than you do said fudge uncomfortably necessary precaution unfortunate but there you are ive just met some of them theyre in a fury against dumbledore he wont let them inside the castle grounds i should think not said professor mcgonagall sharply how are we supposed to teach with those horrors floating around hear hear squeaked tiny professor flitwick whose feet were dangling a foot from the ground all the same demurred fudge they are here to protect you all from something much worse we all know what blacks capable of do you know i still have trouble believing it said madam rosmerta thoughtfully of all the people to go over to the dark side sirius black was the last id have thought i mean i remember him when he was a boy at hogwarts if youd told me then what he was going to become id have said youd had too much mead you dont know the half of it rosmerta said fudge gruffly the worst he did isnt widely known the worst said madam rosmerta her voice alive with curiosity worse than murdering all those poor people you mean i certainly do said fudge i cant believe that what could possibly be worse you say you remember him at hogwarts rosmerta murmured professor mcgonagall do you remember who hisbest friend was naturally said madam rosmerta with a small laugh never saw one without the other did you the number of times i had them in here ooh they used to make me laugh quite the double act sirius black and james potter harry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk ron kicked him precisely said professor mcgonagall black and potter ringleaders of their little gang both very bright of course exceptionally bright in fact but i dont think weve ever had such a pair of troublemakers i dunno chuckled hagrid fred and george weasley could give em a run fer their money youd have thought black and potter were brothers chimed in professor flitwick inseparable of course they were said fudge potter trusted black beyond all his other friends nothing changed when they left school black was best man when james married lily then they named him godfather to harry harry has no idea of course you can imagine how the idea would torment him because black turned out to be in league with youknowwho whispered madam rosmerta worse even than that mdear fudge dropped his voice and proceeded in a sort of low rumble not many people are aware that the potters knew youknowwho was after them dumbledore who was of course working tirelessly against youknowwho had a number of useful spies one of them tipped him off and he alerted james and lily at once he advised them to go into hiding well of course youknowwho wasnt an easy person to hide from dumbledore told them that their best chance was the fidelius charm how does that work said madam rosmerta breathless with interest professor flitwick cleared his throat an immensely complex spell he said squeakily involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single living soul the information is hidden inside the chosen person or secretkeeper and is henceforth impossible to find unless of course the secretkeeper chooses to divulge it as long as the secretkeeper refused to speak youknowwho could search the village where lily and james were staying for years and never find them not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting room window so black was the potters secretkeeper whispered madam rosmerta naturally said professor mcgonagall james potter told dumbledore that black would die rather than tell where they were that black was planning to go into hiding himself and yet dumbledore remained worried i remember him offering to be the potters secret keeper himself he suspected black gasped madam rosmerta he was sure that somebody close to the potters had been keeping youknowwho informed of their movements said professor mcgonagall darkly indeed he had suspected for some time that someone on our side had turned traitor and was passing a lot of information to youknowwho but james potter insisted on using black he did said fudge heavily and then barely a week after the fidelius charm had been performed black betrayed them breathed madam rosmerta he did indeed black was tired of his doubleagent role he was ready to declare his support openly for youknowwho and he seems to have planned this for the moment of the potters death but as we all know youknowwho met his downfall in little harry potter powers gone horribly weakened he fled and this left black in a very nasty position indeed his master had fallen at the very moment when he black had shown his true colors as a traitor he had no choice but to run for it filthy stinkin turncoat hagrid said so loudly that half the bar went quiet shh said professor mcgonagall i met him growled hagrid i musta bin the last ter see him before he killed all them people it was me that rescued harry from lily an jamess house after they was killed jus got him outta the ruins poor little thing with a great slash across his forehead an his parents dead an sirius black turns up on that flyin motorbike he used ter ride never occurred ter me what he was doin there i didn know hed bin lily an jamess secretkeeper thought hed jus heard the news o youknowwhos attack an come ter see what he could do white an shakin he was an yeh know what i did i comforted the murderin traitor hagrid roared hagrid please said professor mcgonagall keep your voice down how was i ter know he wasn upset abou lily an james it was youknowwho he cared abou an then he says give harry ter me hagrid im his godfather ill look after him ha but id had me orders from dumbledore an i told black no dumbledore said harry was ter go ter his aunt an uncles black argued but in the end he gave in told me ter take his motorbike ter get harry there i wont need it anymore he says i shoulda known there was somethin fishy goin on then he loved that motorbike what was he givin it ter me for why wouldn he need it anymore fact was it was too easy ter trace dumbledore knew hed bin the potters secretkeeper black knew he was goin ter have ter run fer it that night knew it was a matter o hours before the ministry was after him but what if id given harry to him eh i bet hed ve pitched him off the bike halfway out ter sea his bes friends son but when a wizard goes over ter the dark side theres nothin and no one that matters to em anymore a long silence followed hagrids story then madam rosmerta said with some satisfaction but he didnt manage to disappear did he the ministry of magic caught up with him next day alas if only we had said fudge bitterly it was not we who found him it was little peter pettigrew another of the potters friends maddened by grief no doubt and knowing that black had been the potters secretkeeper he went after black himself pettigrew that fat little boy who was always tagging around after them at hogwarts said madam rosmerta heroworshipped black and potter said professor mcgonagall never quite in their league talentwise i was often rather sharp with him you can imagine how i how i regret that now she sounded as though she had a sudden head cold there now minerva said fudge kindly pettigrew died a heros death eyewitnesses muggles of course we wiped their memories later told us how pettigrew cornered black they say he was sobbing lily and james sirius how could you and then he went for his wand well of course black was quicker blew pettigrew to smithereens professor mcgonagall blew her nose and said thickly stupid boy foolish boy he was always hopeless at dueling should have left it to the ministry i tell yeh if id got ter black before little pettigrew did i wouldnt ve messed around with wands id ve ripped him limb from limb hagrid growled you dont know what youre talking about hagrid said fudge sharply nobody but trained hit wizards from the magical law enforcement squad would have stood a chance against black once he was cornered i was junior minister in the department of magical catastrophes at the time and i was one of the first on the scene after black murdered all those people i i will never forget it i still dream about it sometimes a crater in the middle of the street so deep it had cracked the sewer below bodies everywhere muggles screaming and black standing there laughing with what was left of pettigrew in front of him a heap of bloodstained robes and a few a few fragments fudges voice stopped abruptly there was the sound of five noses being blown well there you have it rosmerta said fudge thickly black was taken away by twenty members of the magical law enforcement squad and pettigrew received the order of merlin first class which i think was some comfort to his poor mother blacks been in azkaban ever since madam rosmerta let out a long sigh is it true hes mad minister i wish i could say that he was said fudge slowly i certainly believe his masters defeat unhinged him for a while the murder of pettigrew and all those muggles was the action of a cornered and desperate man cruel pointless yet i met black on my last inspection of azkaban you know most of the prisoners in there sit muttering to themselves in the dark theres no sense in them but i was shocked at how normal black seemed he spoke quite rationally to me it was unnerving youd have thought he was merely bored asked if id finished with my newspaper cool as you please said he missed doing the crossword yes i was astounded at how little effect the dementors seemed to be having on him and he was one of the most heavily guarded in the place you know dementors outside his door day and night but what do you think hes broken out to do said madam rosmerta good gracious minister he isnt trying to rejoin youknowwho is he i daresay that is his er eventual plan said fudge evasively but we hope to catch black long before that i must say youknowwho alone and friendless is one thing but give him back his most devoted servant and i shudder to think how quickly hell rise again there was a small chink of glass on wood someone had set down their glass you know cornelius if youre dining with the headmaster hed better head back up to the castle said professor mcgonagall one by one the pairs of feet in front of harry took the weight of their owners once more hems of cloaks swung into sight and madam rosemertas glittering heels disappeared behind the bar the door of the three broomsticks opened again there was another flurry of snow and the teachers had disappeared harry rons and hermiones faces appeared under the table they were both staring at him lost for words chapter eleven the firebolt harry didnt have a very clear idea of how he had managed to get back into the honeydukes cellar through the tunnel and into the castle once more all he knew was that the return trip seemed to take no time at all and that he hardly noticed what he was doing because his head was still pounding with the conversation he had just heard why had nobody ever told him dumbledore hagrid mr weasley cornelius fudge why hadnt anyone ever mentioned the fact that harrys parents had died because their best friend had betrayed them ron and hermione watched harry nervously all through dinner not daring to talk about what theyd overheard because percy was sitting close by them when they went upstairs to the crowded common room it was to find fred and george had set off half a dozen dungbombs in a fit of endofterm high spirits harry who didnt want fred and george asking him whether hed reached hogsmeade or not sneaked quietly up to the empty dormitory and headed straight for his bedside cabinet he pushed his books aside and quickly found what he was looking for the leatherbound photo album hagrid had given him two years ago which was full of wizard pictures of his mother and father he sat down on his bed drew the hangings around him and started turning the pages searching until he stopped on a picture of his parents wedding day there was his father waving up at him beaming the untidy black hair harry had inherited standing up in all directions there was his mother alight with happiness arm in arm with his dad and there that must be him their best man harry had never given him a thought before if he hadnt known it was the same person he would never have guessed it was black in this old photograph his face wasnt sunken and waxy but handsome full of laughter had he already been working for voldemort when this picture had been taken was he already planning the deaths of the two people next to him did he realize he was facing twelve years in azkaban twelve years that would make him unrecognizable but the dementors dont affect him harry thought staring into the handsome laughing face he doesnt have to hear my mom screaming if they get too close harry slammed the album shut reached over and stuffed it back into his cabinet took off his robe and glasses and got into bed making sure the hangings were hiding him from view the dormitory door opened harry said rons voice uncertainly but harry still pretending to be asleep he heard ron leave again and rolled over on his back his eyes wide open a hatred such as he had never known before was coursing through harry like poison he could see black laughing at him through the darkness as though somebody had pasted the picture from the album over his eyes he watched as though somebody was playing him a piece of film sirius black blasting peter pettigrew who resembled neville longbottom into a thousand pieces he could hear though having no idea what blacks voice might sound like a low excited mutter it has happened my lord the potters have made me their secretkeeper and then came another voice laughing shrilly the same laugh that harry heard inside his head whenever the dementors drew near harry you you look terrible harry hadnt gotten to sleep until daybreak he had awoken to find the dormitory deserted dressed and gone down the spiral staircase to a common room that was completely empty except for ron who was eating a peppermint toad and massaging his stomach and hermione who had spread her homework over three tables where is everyone said harry gone its the first day of the holidays remember said ron watching harry closely its nearly lunchtime i was going to come and wake you up in a minute harry slumped into a chair next to the fire snow was still falling outside the windows crookshanks was spread out in front of the fire like a large ginger rug you really don look well you know hermione said peering anxiously into his face im fine said harry harry listen said hermione exchanging a look with ron you must be really upset about what we heard yesterday but the thing is you mustnt go doing anything stupid like what said harry like trying to go after black said ron sharply harry could tell they had rehearsed this conversation while he had been asleep he didnt say anything you wont will you harry said hermione because blacks not worth dying for said ron harry looked at them they didnt seem to understand at all dyou know what i see and hear every time a dementor gets too near me ron and hermione shook their heads looking apprehensive i can hear my mum screaming and pleading with voldemort and if youd heard your mum screaming like that just about to be killed you wouldnt forget it in a hurry and if you found out someone who was supposed to be a friend of hers betrayed her and sent voldemort after her theres nothing you can do said hermione looking stricken the dementors will catch black and hell go back to azkaban and and serve him right you heard what fudge said black isnt affected by azkaban like normal people are its not a punishment for him like it is for the others so what are you saying said ron looking very tense you want to to kill black or something dont be silly said herinione in a panicky voice harry doesnt want to kill anyone do you harry again harry didnt answer he didnt know what he wanted to do all he knew was that the idea of doing nothing while black was at liberty was almost more than he could stand malfoy knows he said abruptly remember what he said to me in potions if it was me id hunt him down myself id want revenge youre going to take malfoys advice instead of ours said ron furiously listen you know what pettigrews mother got back after black had finished with him dad told me the order of merlin first class and pettigrews finger in a box that was the biggest bit of him they could find blacks a madman harry and hes dangerous malfoys dad must have told him said harry ignoring ron he was right in voldemorts inner circle say youknowwho will you interjected ron angrily so obviously the malfoys knew black was working for voldemort and malfoyd love to see you blown into about a million pieces like pettigrew get a grip malfoys just hoping youll get yourself killed before he has to play you at quidditch harry please said hermione her eyes now shining with tears please be sensible black did a terrible terrible thing but ddont put yourself in danger its what black wants oh harry youd be playing right into blacks hands if you went looking for him your mum and dad wouldnt want you to get hurt would they theyd never want you to go looking for black ill never know what theyd have wanted because thanks to black ive never spoken to them said harry shortly there was a silence in which crookshanks stretched luxuriously flexing his claws rons pocket quivered look said ron obviously casting around for a change of subject its the holidays its nearly christmas lets lets go down and see hagrid we havent visited him for ages no said hermione quickly harry isnt supposed to leave the castle ron yeah lets go said harry sitting up and i can ask him how come he never mentioned black when he told me all about my parents further discussion of sirius black plainly wasnt what ron had in mind or we could have a game of chess he said hastily or gobstones percy left a set no lets visit hagrid said harry firmly so they got their cloaks from their dormitories and set off through the portrait hole stand and fight you yellowbellied mongrels down through the empty castle and out through the oak front doors they made their way slowly down the lawn making a shallow trench in the glittering powdery snow their socks and the hems of their cloaks soaked and freezing the forbidden forest looked as though it had been enchanted each tree smattered with silver and hagrids cabin looked like an iced cake ron knocked but there was no answer hes not out is he said hermione who was shivering under her cloak ron had his ear to the door theres a weird noise he said listen is that fang harry and hermione put their ears to the door too from inside the cabin came a series of low throbbing moans think wed better go and get someone said ron nervously hagrid called harry thumping the door hagrid are you in there there was a sound of heavy footsteps then the door creaked open hagrid stood there with his eyes red and swollen tears splashing down the front of his leather vest yehve heard he bellowed and he flung himself onto harrys neck hagrid being at least twice the size of a normal man this was no laughing matter harry about to collapse under hagrids weight was rescued by ron and hermione who each seized hagrid under an arm and heaved him back into the cabin hagrid allowed himself to be steered into a chair and slumped over the table sobbing uncontrollably his face glazed with tears that dripped down into his tangled beard hagrid what is it said hermione aghast harry spotted an officiallooking letter lying open on the table whats this hagrid hagrids sobs redoubled but he shoved the letter toward harry who picked it up and read aloud dear mr hagrid further to our inquiry into the attack by a hippogriff on a student in your class we have accepted the assurances of professor dumbledore that you bear no responsibility for the regrettable incident well thats okay then hagrid said ron clapping hagrid on the shoulder but hagrid continued to sob and waved one of his gigantic hands inviting harry to read on however we must register our concern about the hippogriff in question we have decided to uphold the official complaint of mr lucius malfoy and this matter will therefore be taken to the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures the hearing will take place on april 20th and we ask you to present yourself and your hippogriff at the committees offices in london on that date in the meantime the hippogriff should be kept tethered and isolated yours in fellowship there followed a list of the school governors oh said ron but you said buckbeak isnt a bad hippogriff hagrid i bet hell get off yeh don know them gargoyles at the committee fer the disposal o dangerous creatures choked hagrid wiping his eyes on his sleeve theyve got it in fer interestin creatures a sudden sound from the corner of hagrids cabin made harry ron and hermione whip around buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor i couldn leave him tied up out there in the snow choked hagrid all on his own at christmas harry ron and hermione looked at one another they had never seen eye to eye with hagrid about what he called interesting creatures and other people called terrifying monsters on the other hand there didnt seem to be any particular harm in buckbeak in fact by hagrids usual standards he was positively cute youll have to put up a good strong defense hagrid said hermione sitting down and laying a hand on hagrids massive forearm im sure you can prove buckbeak is safe wont make no diffrence sobbed hagrid them disposal devils theyre all in lucius malfoys pocket scared o him ad if i lose the case buckbeak hagrid drew his finger swiftly across his throat then gave a great wail and lurched forward his face in his arms what about dumbledore hagrid said harry hes done moren enough fer me already groaned hagrid got enough on his plate what with keepin them dementors outta the castle an sirius black lurkin around ron and hermione looked quickly at harry as though expecting him to start berating hagrid for not telling him the truth about black but harry couldnt bring himself to do it not now that he saw hagrid so miserable and scared listen hagrid he said you cant give up hermiones right you just need a good defense you can call us as witnesses im sure ive read about a case of hippogriffbaiting said hermione thoughtfullywhere the hippogriff got off ill look it up for you hagrid and see exactly what happened hagrid howled still more loudly harry and hermione looked at ron to help them er shall i make a cup of tea said ron harry stared at him its what my mum does whenever someones upset ron muttered shrugging at last after many more assurances of help with a steaming mug of tea in front of him hagrid blew his nose on a handkerchief the size of a tablecloth and said yer right i can afford to go ter pieces gotta pull meself together fang the boarhound came timidly out from under the table and laid his head on hagrids knee ive not bin meself lately said hagrid stroking fang with one hand and mopping his face with the other worried abou buckbeak an no one likin me classes we do like them lied hermione at once yeah theyre great said ron crossing his fingers under the table er how are the flobberworms dead said hagrid gloomily too much lettuce oh no said ron his lip twitching an them dementors make me feel ruddy terrible an all said hagrid with a sudden shudder gotta walk past em evry time i want a drink in the three broomsticks s like bein back in azkaban he fell silent gulping his tea harry ron and hermione watched him breathlessly they had never heard hagrid talk about his brief spell in azkaban before after a pause hermione said timidly is it awful in there hagrid yehve no idea said hagrid quietly never bin anywhere like it thought i was goin mad kep goin over horrible stuff in me mind the day i got expelled from hogwarts day me dad died day i had ter let norbert go his eyes filled with tears norbert was the baby dragon hagrid had once won in a game of cards yeh can really remember who yeh are after a while an yeh can really see the point o livin at all i used ter hope id jus die in me sleep when they let me out it was like bein born again evrythin came floodin back it was the bes feelin in the world mind the dementors werent keen on lettin me go but you were innocent said hermione hagrid snorted think that matters to them they don care long as theyve got a couple o hundred humans stuck there with em so they can leech all the happiness out of em they don give a damn whos guilty an whos not hagrid went quiet for a moment staring into his tea then he said quietly thought o jus letting buckbeak go tryin ter make him fly away but how dyeh explain ter a hippogriff its gotta go inter hidin an an im scared o breakin the law he looked up at them tears leaking down his face again i don ever want ter go back ter azkaban the trip to hagrids though far from fun had nevertheless had the effect ron and hermione had hoped though harry had by no means forgotten about black he couldnt brood constantly on revenge if he wanted to help hagrid win his case against the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures he ron and hermione went to the library the next day and returned to the empty common room laden with books that might help prepare a defense for buckbeak the three of them sat in front of the roaring fire slowly turning the pages of dusty volumes about famous cases of marauding beasts speaking occasionally when they ran across something relevant heres something there was a case in 1722 but the hippogriff was convicted ugh look what they did to it thats disgusting this might help look a manticore savaged someone in 1296 and they let the manticore off oh no that was only because everyone was too scared to go near it meanwhile in the rest of the castle the usual magnificent christmas decorations had been put up despite the fact that hardly any of the students remained to enjoy them thick streamers of holly and mistletoe were strung along the corridors mysterious lights shone from inside every suit of armor and the great hall was filled with its usual twelve christmas trees glittering with golden stars a powerful and delicious smell of cooking pervaded the corridors and by christmas eve it had grown so strong that even scabbers poked his nose out of the shelter of rons pocket to sniff hopefully at the air on christmas morning harry was woken by ron throwing his pillow at him oy presents harry reached for his glasses and put them on squinting through the semidarkness to the foot of his bed where a small heap of parcels had appeared ron was already ripping the paper off his own presents another sweater from mum maroon again see if youve got one harry had mrs weasley had sent him a scarlet sweater with the gryffindor lion knitted on the front also a dozen homebaked mince pies some christmas cake and a box of nut brittle as he moved all these things aside he saw a long thin package lying underneath whats that said ron looking over a freshly unwrapped pair of maroon socks in his hand dunno harry ripped the parcel open and gasped as a magnificent gleaming broomstick rolled out onto his bedspread ron dropped his socks and jumped off his bed for a closer look i dont believe it he said hoarsely it was a firebolt identical to the dream broom harry had gone to see every day in diagon alley its handle glittered as he picked it up he could feel it vibrating and let go it hung in midair unsupported at exactly the right height for him to mount it his eyes moved from the golden registration number at the top of the handle right down to the perfectly smooth streamlined birch twigs that made up the tail who sent it to you said ron in a hushed voice look and see if theres a card said harry ron ripped apart the firebolts wrappings nothing blimey whod spend that much on you well said harry feeling stunned im betting it wasnt the dursleys i bet it was dumbledore said ron now walking around and around the firebolt taking in every glorious inch he sent you the invisibility cloak anonymously that was my dads though said harry dumbledore was just passing it on to me he wouldnt spend hundreds of galleons on me he cant go giving students stuff like this thats why he wouldnt say it was from him said ron in case some git like malfoy said it was favoritism hey harry ron gave a great whoop of laughter malfoy wait till he sees you on this hell be sick as a pig this is an international standard broom this is i cant believe this harry muttered running a hand along the firebolt while ron sank onto harrys bed laughing his head off at the thought of malfoy who i know said ron controlling himself i know who it couldve been lupin what said harry now starting to laugh himself lupin listen if he had this much gold hed be able to buy himself some new robes yeah but he likes you said ron and he was away when your nimbus got smashed and he mightve heard about it and decided to visit diagon alley and get this for you what dyou mean he was away said harry he was ill when i was playing in that match well he wasnt in the hospital wing said ron i was there cleaning out the bedpans on that detention from snape remember harry frowned at ron i cant see lupin affording something like this whatre you two laughing about hermione had just come in wearing her dressing gown and carrying crookshanks who was looking very grumpy with a string of tinsel tied around his neck dont bring him in here said ron hurriedly snatching scabbers from the depths of his bed and stowing him in his pajama pocket but hermione wasnt listening she dropped crookshanks onto seamuss empty bed and stared openmouthed at the firebolt oh harry who sent you that no idea said harry there wasnt a card or anything with it to his great surprise hermione did not appear either excited or intrigued by the news on the contrary her face fell and she bit her lip whats the matter with you said ron i dont know said hermione slowly but its a bit odd isnt it i mean this is supposed to be quite a good broom isnt it ron sighed exasperatedly its the best broom there is hermione he said so it mustve been really expensive probably cost more than all the slytherins brooms put together said ron happily well whod send harry something as expensive as that and not even tell him theyd sent it said hermione who cares said ron impatiently listen harry can i have a go on it can i i dont think anyone should ride that broom just yet said hermione shrilly harry and ron looked at her what dyou think harrys going to do with it sweep the floor said ron but before hermione could answer crookshanks sprang from seamuss bed right at rons chest get him out of here ron bellowed as crookshankss claws ripped his pajamas and scabbers attempted a wild escape over his shoulder ron seized scabbers by the tail and aimed a misjudged kick at crookshanks that hit the trunk at the end of harrys bed knocking it over and causing ron to hop up and down howling with pain crookshankss fur suddenly stood on end a shrill tint whistling was filling the room the pocket sneakoscope had become dislodged from uncle vernons old socks and was whirling and gleaming on the floor i forgot about that harry said bending down and picking up the sneakoscope i never wear those socks if i can help it the sneakoscope whirled and whistled in his palm crookshanks was hissing and spitting at it youd better take that cat out of here hermione said ron furiously sitting on harrys bed nursing his toe cant you shut that thing up he added to harry as hermione strode out of the room crookshankss yellow eyes still fixed maliciously on ron harry stuffed the sneakoscope back inside the socks and threw it back into his trunk all that could be heard now were rons stifled moans of pain and rage scabbers was huddled in rons hands it had been a while since harry had seen him out of rons pocket and he was unpleasantly surprised to see that scabbers once so fat was now very skinny patches of fur seemed to have fallen out too hes not looking too good is he harry said its stress said ron hed be fine if that big stupid furball left him alone but harry remembering what the woman at the magical menagerie had said about rats living only three years couldnt help feeling that unless scabbers had powers he had never revealed he was reaching the end of his life and despite rons frequent conplaints that scabbers was both boring and useless he was sure ron would be very miserable if scabbers died christmas spirit was definitely thin on the ground in the gryffindor common room that morning hermione had shut crookshanks in her dormitory but was furious with ron for trying to kick him ron was still fuming about crookshankss fresh attempt to eat scabbers harry gave up trying to make them talk to each other and devoted himself to examining the firebolt which he had brought down to the common room with him for some reason this seemed to annoy hermione as well she didnt say anything but she kept looking darkly at the broom as though it too had been criticizing her cat at lunchtime they went down to the great hall to find that the house tables had been moved against the walls again and that a single table set for twelve stood in the middle of the room professors dumbledore mcgonagall snape sprout and flitwick were there along with filch the caretaker who had taken off his usual brown coat and was wearing a very old and rather moldylooking tailcoat there were only three other students two extremely nervouslooking first years and a sullenfaced slytherin fifth year merry christmas said dumbledore as harry ron and hermione approached the table as there are so few of us it seemed foolish to use the house tables sit down sit down harry ron and hermione sat down side by side at the end of the table crackers said dumbledore enthusiastically offering the end of a large silver noisemaker to snape who took it reluctantly and tugged with a bang like a gunshot the cracker flew apart to reveal a large pointed witchs hat topped with a stuffed vulture harry remembering the boggart caught rons eye and they both grinned snapes mouth thinned and he pushed the hat toward dumbledore who swapped it for his wizards hat at once dig in he advised the table beaming around as harry was helping himself to roast potatoes the doors of the great hall opened again it was professor trelawney gliding toward them as though on wheels she had put on a green sequined dress in honor of the occasion making her look more than ever like a glittering oversized dragonfly sibyll this is a pleasant surprise said dumbledore standing up i have been crystal gazing headmaster said professor trelawney in her mistiest most faraway voice and to my astonishment i saw myself abandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join you who am i to refuse the promptings of fate i at once hastened from my tower and i do beg you to forgive my lateness certainly certainly said dumbledore his eyes twinkling let me draw you up a chair and he did indeed draw a chair in midair with his wand which revolved for a few seconds before falling with a thud between professors snape and mcgonagall professor trelawney however did not sit down her enormous eyes had been roving around the table and she suddenly uttered a kind of soft scream i dare not headmaster if i join the table we shall be thirteen nothing could be more unlucky never forget that when thirteen dine together the first to rise will be the first to die well risk it sibyll said professor mcgonagall inpatiendy do sit down the turkeys getting stone cold professor trelawney hesitated then lowered herself into the empty chair eyes shut and mouth clenched tight as though expecting a thunderbolt to hit the table professor mcgonagall poked a large spoon into the nearest tureen tripe sibyll professor trelawney ignored her eyes open again she looked around once more and said but where is dear professor lupin im afraid the poor fellow is ill again said dumbledore indicating that everybody should start serving themselves most unfortunate that it should happen on christmas day but surely you already knew that sibyll said professor mcgonagall her eyebrows raised professor trelawney gave professor mcgonagall a very cold look certainly i knew minerva she said quietly but one does not parade the fact that one is all knowing i frequently act as though i am not possessed of the inner eye so as not to make others nervous that explains a great deal said professor mcgonagall tartly professor trelawneys voice suddenly became a good deal less misty if you must know minerva i have seen that poor professor lupin will not be with us for very long he seems aware himself that his time is short he positively fled when i offered to crystal gaze for him imagine that said professor mcgonagall dryly i doubt said dumbledore in a cheerful but slightly raised voice which put an end to professor mcgonagall and professor trelawneys conversation that professor lupin is in any immediate danger severus youve made the potion for him again yes headmaster said snape w what said harry scrambling to his feet why it will need to be checked for jinxes said professor mcgonagall of course im no expert but i daresay madam hooch and professor flitwick will strip it down strip it down repeated ron as though professor mcgonagall was mad it shouldnt take more than a few weeks said professor mcgonagall you will have it back if we are sure it is jinxfree theres nothing wrong with it said harry his voice shaking slightly honestly professor you cant know that potter said professor mcgonagall quite kindly not until youve flown it at any rate and im afraid that is out of the question until we are certain that it has not been tampered with i shall keep you informed professor mcgonagall turned on her heel and carried the firebolt out of he portrait hole which closed behind her harry stood staring after her the tin of highfinish polish still clutched in his hands ron however rounded on hermione what did you go running to mcgonagall for hermione threw her book aside she was still pink in the face but stood up and faced ron defiantly because i thought and professor mcgonagall agrees with me that that broom was probably sent to harry by sirius black chapter twelve the patronus harry knew that hermione had meant well but that didnt stop him from being angry with her he had been the owner of the best broom in the world for a few short hours and now because of her interference he didnt know whether he would ever see it again he was positive that there was nothing wrong with the firebolt now but what sort of state would it be in once it had been subjected to all sorts of antijinx tests ron was furious with hermione too as far as he was concerned the strippingdown of a brand new firebolt was nothing less than criminal damage hermione who remained convinced that she had acted for the best started avoiding the common room harry and ron supposed she had taken refuge in the library and didnt try to persuade her to come back all in all they were glad when the rest of the school returned shortly after new year and gryffindor tower became crowded and noisy again wood sought harry out on the night before term started had a good christmas he said and then without waiting for an answer he sat down lowered his voice and said ive been doing some thinking over christmas harry after last match you know if the dementors come to the next one i mean we cant afford you to well wood broke off looking awkward im working on it said harry quickly professor lupin said hed train me to ward off the dementors we should be starting this week he said hed have time after christmas ah said wood his expression clearing well in that case i really didnt want to lose you as seeker harry and have you ordered a new broom yet no said harry what youd better get a move on you know you cant ride that shooting star against ravenclaw he got a firebolt for christmas said ron a firebolt no seriously a a real firebolt dont get excited oliver said harry gloomily i havent got it anymore it was confiscated and he explained all about how the firebolt was now being checked for jinxes jinxed how could it be jinxed sirius black harry said wearily hes supposed to be after me so mcgonagall reckons he might have sent it waving aside the information that a famous murderer was after his seeker wood said but black couldnt have bought a firebolt hes on the run the whole countrys on the lookout for him how could he just walk into quality quidditch supplies and buy a broomstick i know said harry but mcgonagall still wants to strip it down wood went pale ill go and talk to her harry he promised ill make her see reason a firebolt a real firebolt on our team she wants gryffindor to win as much as we do ill make her see sense a firebolt classes started again the next day the last thing anyone felt like doing was spending two hours on the grounds on a raw january morning but hagrid had provided a bonfire full of salamanders for their enjoyment and they spent an unusually good lesson collecting dry wood and leaves to keep the fire blazing while the flameloving lizards scampered up and down the crumbling whitehot logs the first divination lesson of the new term was much less fun professor trelawney was now teaching them palmistry and she lost no time in informing harry that he had the shortest life line she had ever seen it was defense against the dark arts that harry was keen to get to after his conversation with wood he wanted to get started on his antidementor lessons as soon as possible ah yes said lupin when harry reminded him of his promise at the end of class let me see how about eight oclock on thursday evening the history of magic classroom should be large enough ill have to think carefully about how were going to do this we cant bring a real dementor into the castle to practice on still looks ill doesnt he said ron as they walked down the corridor heading to dinner what dyou reckons the matter with him there was a loud and impatient tuh from behind them it was hermione who had been sitting at the feet of a suit of armor repacking her bag which was so full of books it wouldnt close and what are you tutting at us for said ron irritably nothing said hermione in a lofty voice heaving her bag back over her shoulder yes you were said ron i said i wonder whats wrong with lupin and you well isnt it obvious said hermione with a look of maddening superiority if you dont want to tell us dont snapped ron fine said hermione haughtily and she marched off she doesnt know said ron staring resentfully after hermione shes just trying to get us to talk to her again at eight oclock on thursday evening harry left gryffindor tower for the history of magic classroom it was dark and empty when he arrived but he lit the lamps with his wand and had waited only five minutes when professor lupin turned up carrying a large packing case which he heaved onto professor binns desk whats that said harry another boggart said lupin stripping off his cloak ive been combing the castle ever since tuesday and very luckily i found this one lurking inside mr filchs filing cabinet its the nearest well get to a real dementor the boggart will turn into a dementor when he sees you so well be able to practice on him i can store him in my office when were not using him theres a cupboard under my desk hell like okay said harry trying to sound as though he wasnt apprehensive at all and merely glad that lupin had found such a good substitute for a real dementor so professor lupin had taken out his own wand and indicated that harry should do the same the spell i am going to try and teach you is highly advanced magic harry well beyond ordinary wizarding level it is called the patronus charm how does it work said harry nervously well when it works correctly it conjures up a patronus said lupin which is a kind of anti dementor a guardian that acts as a shield between you and the dementor harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a hagridsized figure holding a large club professor lupin continued the patronus is a kind of positive force a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds upon hope happiness the desire to survive but it cannot feel despair as real humans can so the dementors cant hurt it but i must warn you harry that the charm might be too advanced for you many qualified wizards have difficulty with it what does a patronus look like said harry curiously each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it and how do you conjure it with an incantation which will work only if you are concentrating with all your might on a single very happy memory harry cast his mind about for a happy memory certainly nothing that had happened to him at the dursleys was going to do finally he settled on the moment when he had first ridden a broomstick right he said trying to recall as exactly as possible the wonderful soaring sensation of his stomach the incantation is this lupin cleared his throat expecto patronum expecto patronum harry repeated under his breath expecto patronum concentrating hard on your happy memory oh yeah said harry quickly forcing his thoughts back to that first broom ride expecto patrono no patronum sorry expecto patronum expecto patronum something whooshed suddenly out of the end of his wand it looked like a wisp of silvery gas did you see that said harry excitedly something happened very good said lupin smiling right then ready to try it on a dementor yes harry said gripping his wand very tightly and moving into the middle of the deserted classroom he tried to keep his mind on flying but something else kept intruding any second now he might hear his mother again but he shouldnt think of that or he would hear her again and he didnt want to or did he lupin grasped the lid of the packing case and pulled a dementor rose slowly from the box its hooded face turned toward harry one glistening scabbed hand gripping its cloak the lamps around the classroom flickered and went out the dementor stepped from the box and started to sweep silently toward harry drawing a deep rattling breath a wave of piercing cold broke over him expecto patronum harry yelled expecto patronum expecto but the classroom and the dementor were dissolving harry was falling again through thick white fog and his mothers voice was louder than ever echoing inside his head not harry not harry please ill do anything stand aside stand aside girl harry harry jerked back to life he was lying flat on his back on the floor the classroom lamps were alight again he didnt have to ask what had happened sorry he muttered sitting up and feeling cold sweat trickling down behind his glasses are you all right said lupin yes harry pulled himself up on one of the desks and leaned against it here lupin handed him a chocolate frog eat this before we try again i didnt expect you to do it your first time in fact i would have been astounded if you had its getting worse harry muttered biting off the frogs head i could hear her louder that time and him voldemort lupin looked paler than usual harry if you dont want to continue i will more than understand i do said harry fiercely stuffing the rest of the chocolate frog into his mouth ive got to what if the dementors turn up at our match against ravenclaw i cant afford to fall off again if we lose this game weve lost the quidditch cup all right then said lupin you might want to select other memory a happy memory i mean to concentrate on that one doesnt seem to have been strong enough harry thought hard and decided his feelings when gryffindor had won the house championship last year had definitely qualified as very happy he gripped his wand tightly again and took up his position in the middle of the classroom ready said lupin gripping the box lid ready said harry trying hard to fill his head with happy thoughts about gryffindor winning and not dark thoughts about what was going to happen when the box opened go said lupin pulling off the lid the room went icily cold and dark once more the dementor glided forward drawing its breath one rotting hand was extending toward harry expecto patronum harry yelled expecto patronum expecto pat white fog obscured his senses big blurred shapes were moving around him then came a new voice a mans voice shouting panicking lily take harry and go its him go run ill hold him off the sounds of someone stumbling ftom a room a door bursting open a cackle of high pitched laughter harry harry wake up lupin was tapping harry hard on the face this time it was a minute before harry understood why he was lying on a dusty classroom floor i heard my dad harry mumbled thats the first time ive ever heard him he tried to take on voldemort himself to give my mum time to run for it harry suddenly realized that there were tears on his face mingling with the sweat he bent his face as low as possible wiping them off on his robes pretending to do up his shoelace so that lupin wouldnt see you heard james said lupin in a strange voice yeah face dry harry looked up why you didnt know my dad did you i i did as a matter of fact said lupin we were friends at hogwarts listen harry perhaps we should leave it here for tonight this charm is ridiculously advanced i shoulnt have suggested putting you through this no said harry he got up again ill have one more go im not thinking of happy enough things thats what it is hang on he racked his brains a really really happy memory one that he could turn into a good strong patronus the moment when hed first found out he was a wizard and would be leaving the dursleys for hogwarts if that wasnt a happy memory he didnt know what would concentrating very hard on how he had felt when hed realized hed be leaving privet drive harry got to his feet and faced the packing case once more ready said lupin who looked as though he were doing this against his better judgment concentrating hard all right go he pulled off the lid of the case for the third time and the dementor rose out of it the room fell cold and dark expecto patronum harry bellowed expecto patronum expecto patronum the screaming inside harrys head had started again except this time it sounded as though it were coming from a badly tuned radio softer and louder and softer again and he could still see the dementor it had halted and then a huge silver shadow came bursting out of the end of harrys wand to hover between him and the dementor and though harrys legs felt like water he was still on his feet though for how much longer he wasnt sure riddikulus roared lupin springing forward there was a loud crack and harrys cloudy patronus vanished along with the dementor he sank into a chair feeling as exhausted as if hed just run a mile and felt his legs shaking out of the corner of his eye he saw professor lupin forcing the boggart back into the packing case with his wand it had turned into a silvery orb again excellent lupin said striding over to where harry sat excellent harry that was definitely a start can we have another go just one more go not now said lupin firmly youve had enough for one night here he handed harry a large bar of honeydukes best chocolate eat the lot or madam pomfrey will be after my blood same time next week okay said harry he took a bite of the chocolate and watched lupin extinguishing the lamps that had rekindled with the disappearance of the dementor a thought had just occurred to him professor lupin he said if you knew my dad you mustve known sirius black as well lupin turned very quickly what gives you that idea he said sharply nothing i mean i just knew they were friends at hogwarts too lupins face relaxed yes i knew him he said shortly or i thought i did youd better be off harry its getting late harry left the classroom walking along the corridor and around a corner then took a detour behind a suit of armor and sank down on its plinth to finish his chocolate wishing he hadnt mentioned black as lupin was obviously not keen on the subject then harrys thoughts wandered back to his mother and father he felt drained and strangely empty even though he was so full of chocolate terrible thought it was to hear his parents last moments replayed inside his head these were the only times harry had heard their voices since he was a very small child but hed never be able to produce a proper patronus if he half wanted to hear his parents again theyre dead he told himself sternly theyre dead and listening to echoes of them wont bring them back youd better get a grip on yourself if you want that quidditch cup he stood up crammed the last bit of chocolate into his mouth and headed back to gryffindor tower ravenclaw played slytherin a week after the start of term slytherin won though narrowly according to wood this was good news for gryffindor who would take second place if they beat ravenclaw too he therefore increased the number of team practices to five a week this meant that with lupins antidementor classes which in themselves were more draining than six quidditch practices harry had just one night a week to do all his homework even so he was showing the strain nearly as much as hermione whose immense workload finally seemed to be getting to her every night without fail hermione was to be seen in a corner of the common room several tables spread with books arithmancy charts rune dictionaries diagrams of muggles lifting heavy objects and file upon file of extensive notes she barely spoke to anybody and snapped when she was interrupted hows she doing it ron muttered to harry one evening as harry sat finishing a nasty essay on undetectable poisons for snape harry looked up hermione was barely visible behind a tottering pile of books doing what getting to all her classes ron said i heard her talking to professor vector that arithmancy witch this morning they were going on about yesterdays lesson but hermione cant ve been there because she was with us in care of magical creatures and ernie mcmillan told me shes never missed a muggle studies class but half of them are at the same time as divination and shes never missed one of them either harry didnt have time to fathom the mystery of hermiones impossible schedule at the moment he really needed to get on with snapes essay two seconds later however he was interrupted again this time by wood bad news harry ive just been to see professor mcgonagall about the firebolt she er got a bit shirty with me told m id got my priorities wrong seemed to think i cared more about winning the cup than i do about you staying alive just because i told her i didnt care if it threw you off as long as you caught the snitch first wood shook his head in disbelief honestly the way she was yelling at me youd think id said something terrible then i asked her how much longer she was going to keep it he screwed up his face and imitated professor mcgonagalls severe voice as long as necessary wood i reckon its time you ordered a new broom harry theres an order form at the back of which broomstick you could get a nimbus two thousand and one like malfoys got im not buying anything malfoy thinks is good said harry flatly january faded imperceptibly into february with no change in the bitterly cold weather the match against ravenclaw was drawing nearer and nearer but harry still hadnt ordered a new broom he was now asking professor mcgonagall for news of the firebolt after every transfiguration lesson ron standing hopefully at his shoulder hermione rushing past with her face averted no potter you cant have it back yet professor mcgonagall told him the twelfth time this happened before hed even opened his mouth weve checked for most of the usual curses but professor flitwick believes the broom might be carrying a hurling hex i shall tell you once weve finished checking it now please stop badgering me to make matters even worse harrys antidementor lessons were not going nearly as well as he had hoped several sessions on he was able to produce an indistinct silvery shadow every time the boggartdementor approached him but his patronus was too feeble to drive the dementor away all it did was hover like a semitransparent cloud draining harry of energy as he fought to keep it there harry felt angry with himself guilty about his secret desire to hear his parents voices again youre expecting too much of yourself said professor lupin sternly in their fourth week of practice for a thirteenyearold wizard even an indistinct patronus is a huge achievement you arent passing out anymore are you i thought a patronus would charge the dementors down or something said harry dispiritedly make them disappear the true patronus does do that said lupin but youve achieved a great deal in a very short space of time if the dementors put in an appearance at your next quidditch match you will be able to keep them at bay long enough to get back to the ground you said its harder if there are loads of them said harry i have complete confidence in you said lupin smiling here youve earned a drink something from the three broomsticks you wont have tried it before he pulled two bottles out of his briefcase butterbeer said harry without thinking yeah i like that stuff lupin raised an eyebrow oh ron and hermione brought me some back from hogsmeade harry lied quickly i see said lupin though he still looked slightly suspicious well lets drink to a gryffindor victory against ravenclaw not that im supposed to take sides as a teacher he added hastily they drank the butterbeer in silence until harry voiced something hed been wondering for a while whats under a dementors hood professor lupin lowered his bottle thoughtfully hmmm well the only people who really know are in no condition to tell us you see the dementor lowers its hood only to use its last and worst weapon whats that they call it the dementors kiss said lupin with a slightly twisted smile its what dementors do to those they wish to destroy utterly i suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there because they clamp their jaws upon the mouth of the victim and and suck out his soul harry accidentally spat out a bit of butterbeer what they kill oh no said lupin much worse than that you can exist without your soul you know as long as your brain and heart are still working but youll have no sense of self anymore no memory no anything theres no chance at all of recovery youll just exist as an empty shell and your soul is gone forever lost lupin drank a little more butterbeer then said its the fate that awaits sirius black it was in the daily prophet this morning the ministry have given the dementors permission to perform it if they find him harry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of someone having their soul sucked out through their mouth but then he thought of black he deserves it he said suddenly you think so said lupin lightly do you really think anyone deserves that yes said harry defiantly for for some things he would have liked to have told lupin about the conversation hed overheard about black in the three broomsticks about black betraying his mother and father but it would have involved revealing that hed gone to hogsmeade without permission and he knew lupin wouldnt be very impressed by that so he finished his butterbeer thanked lupin and left the history of magic classroom harry half wished that he hadnt asked what was under a dementors hood the answer had been so horrible and he was so lost in unpleasant thoughts of what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of you that he walked headlong into professor mcgonagall halfway up the stairs do watch where youre going potter sorry professor ive just been looking for you in the gryffindor common room well here it is weve done everything we could think of and there doesnt seem to be anything wrong with it at all youve got a very good friend somewhere potter harrys jaw dropped she was holding out his firebolt and it looked as magnificent as ever i can have it back harry said weakly seriously seriously said professor mcgonagall and she was actually smiling i daresay youll need to get the feel of it before saturdays match wont you and potter do try and win wont you or well be out of the running for the eighth year in a row as professor snape was kind enough to remind me only last night speechless harry carried the firebolt back upstairs toward gryffindor tower as he turned a corner he saw ron dashing toward him grinning from ear to ear she gave it to you excellent listen can i still have a go on it tomorrow yeah anything said harry his heart lighter than it had been in a month you know what we should make up with hermione she was only trying to help yeah all right said ron shes in the common room now working for a change they turned into the corridor to gryffindor tower and saw neville longbottom pleading with sir cadogan who seemed to be refusing him entrance i wrote them down neville was saying tearfully but i mustve dropped them somewhere a likely tale roared sir cadogan then spotting harry and ron good even my fine young yeomen come clap this loon in irons he is trying to force entry to the chambers within oh shut up said ron as he and harry drew level with neville ive lost the passwords neville told them miserably i made him tell me what passwords he was going to use this week because he keeps changing them and now i dont know what ive done with them oddsbodikins said harry to sir cadogan who looked extremely disappointed and reluctantly swung forward to let them into the common room there was a sudden excited murmur as every head turned and the next moment harry was surrounded by people exclaiming over his firebolt whered you get it harry will you let me have a go have you ridden it yet harry ravenclawll have no chance theyre all on cleansweep sevens can i just hold it harry after ten minutes or so during which the firebolt was passed around and admired from every angle the crowd dispersed and harry and ron had a clear view of hermione the only person who hadnt rushed over to them bent over her work and carefully avoiding their eyes harry and ron approached her table and at last she looked up i got it back said harry grinning at her and holding up the firebolt see hermione there wasnt anything wrong with it said ron well there might have been said hermione i mean at least you know now that its safe yeah i suppose so said harry id better put it upstairs ill take it said ron eagerly ive got to give scabbers his rat tonic he took the firebolt and holding it as if it were made of glass carried it away up the boys staircase can i sit down then harry asked hermione i suppose so said hermione moving a great stack of parchment off a chair harry looked around at the cluttered table at the long arithmancy essay on which the ink was still glistening at the even longer muggle studies essay explain why muggles need electricity and at the rune translation hermione was now poring over how are you getting through all this stuff harry asked her oh well you know working hard said hermione closeup harry saw that she looked almost as tired as lupin why dont you just drop a couple of subjects harry asked watching her lifting books as she searched for her rune dictionary i couldnt do that said hermione looking scandalized arithmancy looks terrible said harry picking up a very complicatedlooking number chart oh no its wonderful said hermione earnestly its my favorite subject its but exactly what was wonderful about arithmancy harry never found out at that precise moment a strangled yell echoed down the boys staircase the whole common room fell silent staring petrified at the entrance then came hurried footsteps growing louder and louder and then ron came leaping into view dragging with him a bedsheet look he bellowed striding over to hermiones table look he yelled shaking the sheets in her face ron what scabbers look scabbers hermione was leaning away from ron looking utterly bewildered harry looked down at the sheet ron was holding there was something red on it something that looked horribly like blood ron yelled into the stunned silence hes gone and you know what was on the floor n no said hermione in a trembling voice ron threw something down onto hermiones rune translation hermione and harry leaned forward lying on top of the weird spiky shapes were several long ginger cat hairs chapter thirteen gryffindor versus ravenclaw it looked like the end of ron and hermiones friendship each was so angry with the other that harry couldnt see how theyd ever make up ron was enraged that hermione had never taken crookshankss attempts to eat scabbers seriously hadnt bothered to keep a close enough watch on him and was still trying to pretend that crookshanks was innocent by suggesting that ron look for scabbers under all the boys beds hermione meanwhile maintained fiercely that ron had no proof that crookshanks had eaten scabbers that the ginger hairs might have been there since christmas and that ron had been prejudiced against her cat ever since crookshanks had landed on rons head in the magical menagerie personally harry was sure that crookshanks had eaten scabbers and when he tried to point out to hermione that the evidence all pointed that way she lost her temper with harry too okay side with ron i knew you would she said shrilly first the firebolt now scabbers everythings my fault isnt it just leave me alone harry ive got a lot of work to do ron had taken the loss of his rat very hard indeed come on ron you were always saying how boring scabbers was said fred bracingly and hes been offcolor for ages he was wasting away it was probably better for him to snuff it quickly one swallow he probably didnt feel a thing fred said ginny indignantly all he did was eat and sleep ron you said it yourself said george he bit goyle for us once ron said miserably remember harry yeah thats true said harry his finest hour said fred unable to keep a straight face let the scar on goyles finger stand as a lasting tribute to his memory oh come on ron get yourself down to hogsmeade and buy a new rat whats the point of moaning in a lastditch attempt to cheer ron up harry persuaded him to come along to the gryffindor teams final practice before the ravenclaw match so that he could have a ride on the firebolt after theyd finished this did seem to take rons mind off scabbers for a moment great can i try and shoot a few goals on it so they set off for the quidditch field together madam hooch who was still overseeing gryffindor practices to keep an eye on harry was just as impressed with the firebolt as everyone else had been she took it in her hands before takeoff and gave them the benefit of her professional opinion look at the balance on it if the nimbus series has a fault its a slight list to the tail end you often find they develop a drag after a few years theyve updated the handle too a bit slimmer than the cleansweeps reminds me of the old silver arrows a pity theyve stopped making them i learned to fly on one and a very fine old broom it was too she continued in this vein for some time until wood said er madam hooch is it okay if harry has the firebolt back we need to practice oh right here you are then potter said madam hooch ill sit over here with weasley she and ron left the field to sit in the stadium and the gryffindor team gathered around wood for his final instructions for tomorrows match harry ive just found out who ravenclaw is playing as seeker its cho chang shes a fourth year and shes pretty good i really hoped she wouldnt be fit shes had some problems with injuries wood scowled his displeasure that cho chang had made a full recovery then said on the other hand she rides a comet two sixty which is going to look like a joke next to the firebolt he gave harrys broom a look of fervent admiration then said okay everyone lets go and at long last harry mounted his firebolt and kicked off from the ground it was better than hed ever dreamed the firebolt turned with the lightest touch it seemed to obey his thoughts rather than his grip it sped across the field at such speed that the stadium turned into a greenandgray blur harry turned it so sharply that alicia spinnet screamed then he went into a perfectly controlled dive brushing the grassy field with his toes before rising thirty forty fifty feet into the air again harry im letting the snitch out wood called harry turned and raced a bludger toward the goal posts he outstripped it easily saw the snitch dart out from behind wood and within ten seconds had caught it tightly in his hand the team cheered madly harry let the snitch go again gave it a minutes head start then tore after it weaving in and out of the others he spotted it lurking near katie bells knee looped her easily and caught it again it was the best practice ever the team inspired by the presence of the firebolt in their midst performed their best moves faultlessly and by the time they hit the ground again wood didnt have a single criticism to make which as george weasley pointed out was a first i cant see whats going to stop us tomorrow said wood not unless harry youve sorted out your dementor problem havent you yeah said harry thinking of his feeble patronus and wishing it were stronger the dementors wont turn up again oliver dumbledored go ballistic said fred confidently well lets hope not said wood anyway good work everyone lets get back to the tower turn in early im staying out for a bit ron wants a go on the firebolt harry told wood and while the rest of the team headed off to the locker rooms harry strode over to ron who vaulted the barrier to the stands and came to meet him madam hooch had fallen asleep in her seat here you go said harry handing ron the firebolt ron an expression of ecstasy on his face mounted the broom and zoomed off into the gathering darkness while harry walked around the edge of the field watching him night had fallen before madam hooch awoke with a start told harry and ron off for not waking her and insisted that they go back to the castle harry shouldered the firebolt and he and ron walked out of the shadowy stadium discussing the firebolts superbly smooth action its phenomenal acceleration and its pinpoint turning they were halfway toward the castle when harry glancing to his left saw something that made his heart turn over a pair of eyes gleaming out of the darkness harry stopped dead his heart banging against his ribs whats the matter said ron harry pointed ron pulled out his wand and muttered lumos a beam of light fell across the grass hit the bottom of a tree and illuminated its branches there crouching among the budding leaves was crookshanks get out of here ron roared and he stooped down and seized a stone lying on the grass but before he could do anything else crookshanks had vanished with one swish of his long ginger tail see ron said furiously chucking the stone down again shes still letting him wander about wherever he wants probably washing down scabbers with a couple of birds now harry didnt say anything he took a deep breath as relief seeped through him he had been sure for a moment that those eyes had belonged to the grim they set off for the castle once more slightly ashamed of his moment of panic harry didnt say anything to ron nor did he look left or right until they had reached the welllit entrance hall harry went down to breakfast the next morning with the rest of the boys in his dormitory all of whom seemed to think the firebolt deserved a sort of guard of honor as harry entered the great hall heads turned in the direction of the firebolt and there was a good deal of excited muttering harry saw with enormous satisfaction that the slytherin team were all looking thunderstruck did you see his face said ron gleefully looking back at malfoy he cant believe it this is brilliant wood too was basking in the reflected glory of the firebolt put it here harry he said laying the broom in the middle of the table and carefully turning it so that its name faced upward people from the ravenclaw and hufflepuff tables were soon coming over to look cedric diggory came over to congratulate harry on having acquired such a superb replacement for his nimbus and percys ravenclaw girlfriend penelope clearwater asked if she could actually hold the firebolt now now penny no sabotage said percy heartily as she examined the firebolt closely penelope and i have got a bet on he told the team ten galleons on the outcome of the match penelope put the firebolt down again thanked harry and went back to her table harry make sure you win said percy in an urgent whisper i havent got ten galleons yes im coming penny andhe bustled off to join her in a piece of toast sure you can manage that broom potter said a cold drawling voice draco malfoy had arrived for a closer look crabbe and coyle right behind him yeah reckon so said harry casually got plenty of special features hasnt it said malfoy eyes glittering maliciously shame it doesnt come with a parachute in case you get too near a dementor crabbe and goyle sniggered pity you cant attach an extra arm to yours malfoy said harry then it could catch the snitch for you the gryffindor team laughed loudly malfoys pale eyes narrowed and he stalked away they watched him rejoin the rest of the slytherin team who put their heads together no doubt asking malfoy whether harrys broom really was a firebolt at a quarter to eleven the gryffindor team set off for the locker rooms the weather couldnt have been more different from their match against hufflepuff it was a clear cool day with a very light breeze there would be no visibility problems this time and harry though nervous was starting to feel the excitement only a quidditch match could bring they could hear the rest of the school moving into the stadium beyond harry took off his black school robes removed his wand from his pocket and stuck it inside the tshirt he was going to wear under his quidditch robes he only hoped he wouldnt need it he wondered suddenly whether professor lupin was in the crowd watching you know what weve got to do said wood as they prepared to leave the locker rooms if we lose this match were out of the running just just fly like you did in practice yesterday and well be okay they walked out onto the field to tumultuous applause the ravenclaw team dressed in blue were already standing in the middle of the field their seeker cho chang was the only girl on their team she was shorter than harry by about a head and harry couldnt help noticing nervous as he was that she was extremely pretty she smiled at harry as the teams faced each other behind their captains and he felt a slight lurch in the region of his stomach that he didnt think had anything to do with nerves wood davies shake hands madam hooch said briskly and wood shook hands with the ravenclaw captain mount your brooms on my whistle three two one harry kicked off into the air and the firebolt zoomed higher and faster than any other broom he soared around the stadium and began squinting around for the snitch listening all the while to the commentary which was being provided by the weasley twins friend lee jordan theyre off and the big excitement this match is the firebolt that harry potter is flying for gryffindor according to which broomstick the firebolts going to be the broom of choice for the national teams at this years world championship jordan would you mind telling us whats going on in the match interrupted professor mcgonagalls voice right you are professor just giving a bit of background information the firebolt incidentally has a builtin autobrake and jordan okay okay gryffindor in possession katie bell of gryffindor heading for goal harry streaked past katie in the opposite direction gazing around for a glint of gold and noticing that cho chang was tailing him closely she was undoubtedly a very good flier she kept cutting across him forcing him to change direction show her your acceleration harry fred yelled as he whooshed past in pursuit of a bludger that was aiming for alicia harry urged the firebolt forward as they rounded the ravenclaw goal posts and cho fell behind just as katie succeeded in scoring the first goal of the match and the gryffindor end of the field went wild he saw it the snitch was close to the ground flitting near one of the barriers harry dived cho saw what he was doing and tore after him harry was speeding up excitement flooding him dives were his speciality he was ten feet away then a bludger hit by one of the ravenclaw beaters came pelting out of nowhere harry veered off course avoiding it by an inch and in those few crucial seconds the snitch had vanished there was a great ooooooh of disappointment from the gryffindor supporters but much applause for their beater from the ravenclaw end george weasley vented his feelings by hitting the second bludger directly at the offending beater who was forced to roll right over in midair to avoid it gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero and look at that firebolt go potters really putting it through its paces now see it turn changs comet is just no match for it the firebolts precision balance is really noticeable in these long jordan are you being paid to advertise firebolts get on with the commentary ravenclaw was pulling back they had now scored three goals which put gryffindor only fifty points ahead if cho got the snitch before him ravenclaw would win harry dropped lower narrowly avoiding a ravenclaw chaser scanning the field frantically a glint of gold a flutter of tiny wings the snitch was circling the gryffindor goal post harry accelerated eyes fixed on the speck of gold ahead but just then cho appeared out of thin air blocking him harry this is no time to be a gentleman wood roared as harry swerved to avoid a collision knock her off her broom if you have to harry turned and caught sight of cho she was grinning the snitch had vanished again harry turned his firebolt upward and was soon twenty feet above the game out of the corner of his eye he saw cho following him shed decided to mark him rather than search for the snitch herself all right then if she wanted to tail him shed have to take the consequences he dived again and cho thinking hed seen the snitch tried to follow harry pulled out of the dive very sharply she hurtled downward he rose fast as a bullet once more and then saw it for the third time the snitch was glittering way above the field at the ravenclaw end he accelerated so many feet below cho he was winning gaining on the snitch with every second then oh screamed cho pointing distracted harry looked down three dementors three tall black hooded dementors were looking up at him he didnt stop to think plunging a hand down the neck of his robes he whipped out his wand and roared expecto patronum something silverwhite something enormous erupted from the end of his wand he knew it had shot directly at the dementors but didnt pause to watch his mind still miraculously clear he looked ahead he was nearly there he stretched out the hand still grasping his wand and just managed to close his fingers over the small struggling snitch madam hoochs whistle sounded harry turned around in midair and saw six scarlet blurs bearing down on him next moment the whole team was hugging him so hard he was nearly pulled off his broom down below he could hear the roars of the gryffindors in the crowd thats my boy wood kept yelling alicia angelina and katie had all kissed harry fred had him in a grip so tight harry felt as though his head would come off in complete disarray the team managed to make its way back to the ground harry got off his broom and looked up to see a gaggle of gryffindor supporters sprinting onto the field ron in the lead before he knew it he had been engulfed by the cheering crowd yes ron yelled yanking harrys arm into the air yes yes well done harry said percy looking delighted ten galleons to me must find penelope excuse me good for you harry roared seamus finnigan ruddy brilliant boomed hagrid over the heads of the milling gryffindors that was quite some patronus said a voice in harrys ear harry turned around to see professor lupin who looked both shaken and pleased the dementors didnt affect me at all harry said excitedly i didnt feel a thing that would be because they er werent dementors said professor lupin come and see he led harry out of the crowd until they were able to see the edge of the field you gave mr malfoy quite a fright said lupin harry stared lying in a crumpled heap on the ground were malfoy crabbe goyle and marcus flint the slytherin team captain all struggling to remove themselves from long black hooded robes it looked as though malfoy had been standing on goyles shoulders standing over them with an expression of the utmost fury on her face was professor mcgonagall an unworthy trick she was shouting a low and cowardly attempt to sabotage the gryffindor seeker detention for all of you and fifty points from slytherin i shall be speaking to professor dumbledore about this make no mistake ah here he comes now if anything could have set the seal on gryffindors victory it was this ron who had fought his way through to harrys side doubled up with laughter as they watched malfoy fighting to extricate himself from the robe goyles head still stuck inside it come on harry said george fighting his way over party gryffindor common room now right said harry and feeling happier than he had in ages he and the rest of the team led the way still in their scarlet robes out of the stadium and back up to the castle it felt as though they had already won the quidditch cup the party went on all day and well into the night fred and george weasley disappeared for a couple of hours and returned with armfuls of bottles of butterbeer pumpkin fizz and several bags full of honeydukes sweets how did you do that squealed angelina johnson as george started throwing peppermint toads into the crowd with a little help from moony wormtail padfoot and prongs fred muttered in harrys ear only one person wasnt joining in the festivities hermione incredibly was sitting in a corner attempting to read an enormous book entitled home life and social habits of british muggles harry broke away from the table where fred and george had started juggling butterbeer bottles and went over to her did you even come to the match he asked her of course i did said hermione in a strangely highpitched voice not looking up and im very glad we won and i think you did really well but i need to read this by monday come on hermione come and have some food harry said looking over at ron and wondering whether he was in a good enough mood to bury the hatchet i cant harry ive still got four hundred and twentytwo pages to read said hermione now sounding slightly hysterical anyway she glanced over at ron too he doesnt want me to join in there was no arguing with this as ron chose that moment to say loudly if scabbers hadnt just been eaten he could have had some of those fudge flies he used to really like them hermione burst into tears before harry could say or do anything she tucked the enormous book under her arm and still sobbing ran toward the staircase to the girls dormitories and out of sight cant you give her a break harry asked ron quietly no said ron flatly if she just acted like she was sorry but shell never admit shes wrong hermione shes still acting like scabbers has gone on vacation or something the gryffindor party ended only when professor mcgonagall turned up in her tartan dressing gown and hair net at one in the morning to insist that they all go to bed harry and ron climbed the stairs to their dormitory still discussing the match at last exhausted harry climbed into bed twitched the hangings of his fourposter shut to block out a ray of moonlight lay back and felt himself almost instantly drifting off to sleep he had a very strange dream he was walking through a forest his firebolt over his shoulder following something silverywhite it was winding its way through the trees ahead and he could only catch glimpses of it between the leaves anxious to catch up with it he sped up but as he moved faster so did his quarry harry broke into a run and ahead he heard hooves gathering speed now he was running flat out and ahead he could hear galloping then he turned a corner into a clearing and aaarrgghh nooo harry woke as suddenly as though hed been hit in the face disoriented in the total darkness he fumbled with his hangings he could hear movements around him and seamus finnigans voice from the other side of the room whats going on harry thought he heard the dormitory door slam at last finding the divide in his curtains he ripped them back and at the same moment dean thomas lit his lamp ron was sitting up in bed the hangings torn from one side a look of utmost terror on his face black sirius black with a knife what here just now slashed the curtains woke me up you sure you werent dreaming ron said dean look at the curtains i tell you he was here they all scrambled out of bed harry reached the dormitory door first and they sprinted back down the staircase doors opened behind them and sleepy voices called after them who shouted whatre you doing the common room was lit with the glow of the dying fire still littered with the debris from the party it was deserted are you sure you werent dreaming ron im telling you i saw him whats all the noise professor mcgonagall told us to go to bed a few of the girls had come down their staircase pulling or dressing gowns and yawning boys too were reappearing excellent are we carrying on said fred weasley brightly everyone back upstairs said percy hurrying into the common room and pinning his head boy badge to his pajamas as he spoke perce sirius black said ron faintly in our dormitory with a knife woke me up the common room went very still nonsense said percy looking startled you had too much to eat ron had a nightmare im telling you now really enoughs enough professor mcgonagall was back she slammed the portrait behind her as she entered the common room and stared furiously around i am delighted that gryffindor won the match but this is getting ridiculous percy i expected better of you i certainly didnt authorize this professor said percy puffing himself up indignantly i was just telling them all to get back to bed my brother ron here had a nightmare it wasnt a nightmare ron yelled professor i woke up and sirius black was standing over me holding a knife professor mcgonagall stared at him dont be ridiculous weasley how could he possibly have gotten through the portrait hole ask him said ron pointing a shaking finger at the back of sir cadogans picture ask him if he saw glaring suspiciously at ron professor mcgonagall pushed the portrait back open and went outside the whole common room listened with bated breath sir cadogan did you just let a man enter gryffindor tower certainly good lady cried sir cadogan there was a stunned silence both inside and outside the common room you you did said professor mcgonagall but but the password he had em said sir cadogan proudly had the whole weeks my lady read em off a little piece of paper professor mcgonagall pulled herself back through the portrait hole to face the stunned crowd she was white as chalk which person she said her voice shaking which abysmally foolish person wrote down this weeks passwords and left them lying around there was utter silence broken by the smallest of terrified squeaks neville longbottom trembling from head to fluffy slippered toes raised his hand slowly into the air chapter fourteen snapes grudge no one in gryffindor tower slept that night they knew that the castle was being searched again and the whole house stayed awake in the common room waiting to hear whether black had been caught professor mcgonagall came back at dawn to tell them that he had again escaped throughout the day everywhere they went they saw signs of tighter security professor flitwick could be seen teaching the front doors to recognize a large picture of sirius black filch was suddenly bustling up and down the corridors boarding up everything from tiny cracks in the walls to mouse holes sir cadogan had been fired his portrait had been taken back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor and the fat lady was back she had been expertly restored but was still extremely nervous and had agreed to return to her job only on condition that she was given extra protection a bunch of surly security trolls had been hired to guard her they paced the corridor in a menacing group talking in grunts and comparing the size of their clubs harry couldnt help noticing that the statue of the oneeyed witch on the third floor remained unguarded and unblocked it seemed that fred and george had been right in thinking that they and now harry ron and hermione were the only ones who knew about the hidden passageway within it dyou reckon we should tell someone harry asked ron we know hes not coming in through honeydukes said ron dismissively wedve heard if the shop had been broken into harry was glad ron took this view if the oneeyed witch was boarded up too he would never be able to go into hogsmeade again ron had become an instant celebrity for the first time in his life people were paying more attention to him than to harry and it was clear that ron was rather enjoying the experience though still severely shaken by the nights events he was happy to tell anyone who asked what had happened with a wealth of detail i was asleep and i heard this ripping noise and i thought it was in my dream you know but then there was this draft i woke up and one side of the hangings on my bed had been pulled down i rolled over and i saw him standing over me like a skeleton with loads of filthy hair holding this great long knife mustve been twelve inches and he looked at me and i looked at him and then i yelled and he scampered why though ron added to harry as the group of second year girls who had been listening to his chilling tale departed why did he run harry had been wondering the same thing why had black having got the wrong bed not silenced ron and proceeded to harry black had proved twelve years ago that he didnt mind murdering innocent people and this time he had been facing five unarmed boys four of whom were asleep he mustve known hed have a job getting back out of the castle once youd yelled and woken people up said harry thoughtfully hedve had to kill the whole house to get back through the portrait hole then he would ve met the teachers neville was in total disgrace professor mcgonagall was so furious with him she had banned him from all future hogsmeade visits given him a detention and forbidden anyone to give him the password into the tower poor neville was forced to wait outside the common room every night for somebody to let him in while the security trolls leered unpleasantly at him none of these punishments however came close to matching the one his grandmother had in store for him two days after blacks breakin she sent neville the very worst thing a hogwarts student could receive over breakfast a howler the school owls swooped into the great hall carrying the mail as usual and neville choked as a huge barn owl landed in front of him a scarlet envelope clutched in its beak harry and ron who were sitting opposite him recognized the letter as a howler at once ron had got one from his mother the year before run for it neville ron advised neville didnt need telling twice he seized the envelope and holding it before him like a bomb sprinted out of the hall while the slytherin table exploded with laughter at the sight of him they heard the howler go off in the entrance hall nevilles grandmothers voice magically magnified to a hundred times its usual volume shrieking about how he had brought shame on the whole family harry was too busy feeling sorry for neville to notice immediately that he had a letter too hedwig got his attention by nipping him sharply on the wrist ouch oh thanks hedwig harry tore open the envelope while hedwig helped herself to some of nevilles cornflakes the note inside said dear harry and ron how about having tea with me this afternoon round six ill come collect you from the castle wait for me in the entrance hall youre not allowed out on your own cheers hagrid he probably wants to hear all about black said ron so at six oclock that afternoon harry and ron left gryffindor tower passed the security trolls at a run and headed down to the entrance hall hagrid was already waiting for them all right hagrid said ron spose you want to hear about saturday night do you ive already heard all abou it said hagrid opening the front doors and leading them outside oh said ron looking slightly put out the first thing they saw on entering hagrids cabin was buckbeak who was stretched out on top of hagrids patchwork quilt his enormous wings folded tight to his body enjoying a large plate of dead ferrets averting his eyes from this unpleasant sight harry saw a gigantic hairy brown suit and a very horrible yellowandorange tie hanging from the top of hagrids wardrobe door what are they for hagrid said harry buckbeaks case against the committee fer the disposal o dangerous creatures said hagrid this friday him an mell be goin down ter london together ive booked two beds on the knight bus harry felt a nasty pang of guilt he had completely forgotten that buckbeaks trial was so near and judging by the uneasy look on rons face he had too they had also forgotten their promise about helping him prepare buckbeaks defense the arrival of the firebolt had driven it clean out of their minds hagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of bath buns but they knew better than to accept they had had too much experience with hagrids cooking i got somethin ter discuss with you two said hagrid sitting himself between them and looking uncharacteristically serious what said harry hermione said hagrid what about her said ron shes in a righ state thats what shes bin comin down ter visit me a lot since chrismas bin feelin lonely firs yeh weren talking to her because o the firebolt now yer not talkin to her because her cat ate scabbers ron interjected angrily because her cat acted like

has an you two not talkin to her if shed just get rid of that cat id speak to her again ron said angrily but shes still sticking up for it its a maniac and she wont hear a word against it ah well people can be a bit stupid abou their pets said hagrid wisely behind him buckbeak spat a few ferret bones onto hagrids pillow they spent the rest of their visit discussing gryffindors improved chances for the quidditch cup at nine oclock hagrid walked them back up to the castle a large group of people was bunched around the bulletin board when they returned to the common room hogsmeade next weekend said ron craning over the heads to read the new notice what dyou reckon he added quietly to harry as they went to sit down well filch hasnt done anything about the passage into honeydukes harry said even more quietly harry said a voice in his right ear harry started and looked around at hermione who was sitting at the table right behind them and clearing a space in the wall of books that had been hiding her harry if you go into hogsmeade again ill tell professor mcgonagall about that map said hermione can you hear someone talking harry growled ron not looking at hermione ron how can you let him go with you after what sirius black nearly did to you i mean it ill tell so now youre trying to get harry expelled said ron furiously havent you done enough damage this year hermione opened her mouth to respond but with a soft hiss crookshanks leapt onto her lap hermione took one frightened look at the expression on rons face gathered up crookshanks and hurried away toward the girls dormitories so how about it ron said to harry as though there had been no interruption come on last time we went you didnt see anything you havent even been inside zonkos yet harry looked around to check that hermione was well out of earshot okay he said but im taking the invisibility cloak this time on saturday morning harry packed his invisibility cloak in his bag slipped the marauders map into his pocket and went down to breakfast with everyone else hermione kept shooting suspicious looks down the table at him but he avoided her eye and was careful to let her see him walking back up the marble staircase in the entrance hall as everybody else proceeded to the front doors bye harry called to ron see you when you get back ron grinned and winked harry hurried up to the third floor slipping the marauders map out of his pocket as he went crouching behind the oneeyed witch he smoothed it out a tiny dot was moving in his direction harry squinted at it the minuscule writing next to it read neville longbottom harry quickly pulled out his wand muttered dissendium and shoved his bag into the statue but before he could climb in himself neville came around the corner harry i forgot you werent going to hogsmeade either hi neville said harry moving swiftly away from the statue and pushing the map back into his pocket what are you up to nothing shrugged neville want a game of exploding snap er not now i was going to go to the library and do that vampire essay for lupin ill come with you said neville brightly i havent done it either er hang on yeah i forgot i finished it last night great you can help me said neville his round face anxious i dont understand that thing about the garlic at all do they have to eat it or he broke off with a small gasp looking over harrys shoulder it was snape neville took a quick step behind harry and what are you two doing here said snape coming to a halt and looking from one to the other an odd place to meet to harrys immense disquiet snapes black eyes flicked to the doorways on either side of them and then to the oneeyed witch were not meeting here said harry we just met here indeed said snape you have a habit of turning up in unexpected places potter and you are very rarely there for no good reason i suggest the pair of you return to gryffindor tower where you belong harry and neville set off without another word as they turned the corner harry looked back snape was running one of his hands over the oneeyed witchs head examining it closely harry managed to shake neville off at the fat lady by telling him the password then pretending hed left his vampire essay in the library and doubling back once out of sight of the security trolls he pulled out the map again and held it close to his nose the third floor corridor seemed to be deserted harry scanned the map carefully and saw with a leap of relief that the tiny dot labeled severus snape was now back in its office he sprinted back to the oneeyed witch opened her hump heaved himself inside and slid down to meet his bag at the bottom of the stone chute he wiped the marauders map blank again then set off at a run harry completely hidden beneath the invisibility cloak emerged into the sunlight outside honeydukes and prodded ron in the back its me he muttered what kept you ron hissed snape was hanging around they set off up the high street where are you ron kept muttering out of the corner of his mouth are you still there this feels weird they went to the post office ron pretended to be checking the price of an owl to bill in egypt so that harry could have a good look around the owls sat hooting softly down at him at least three hundred of them from great grays right down to tiny little scoops owls local deliveries only which were so small they could have sat in the palm of harrys hand then they visited zonkos which was so packed with students harry had to exercise great care not to tread on anyone and cause a panic there were jokes and tricks to fulfill even freds and georges wildest dreams harry gave ron whispered orders and passed him some gold from under the cloak they left zonkos with their money bags considerably lighter than they had been on entering but their pockets bulging with dungbombs hiccup sweets frog spawn soap and a nosebiting teacupapiece the day was fine and breezy and neither of them felt like staying indoors so they walked past the three broomsticks and climbed a slope to visit the shrieking shack the most haunted dwelling in britain it stood a little way above the rest of the village and even in daylight was slightly creepy with its boarded windows and dank overgrown garden even the hogwarts ghosts avoid it said ron as they leaned on the fence looking up at it i asked nearly headless nick he says hes heard a very rough crowd lives here no one can get in fred and george tried obviously but all the entrances are sealed shut harry feeling hot from their climb was just considering taking off the cloak for a few minutes when they heard voices nearby someone was climbing toward the house from the other side of the hill moments later malfoy had appeared followed closely by crabbe and goyle malfoy was speaking should have an owl from father any time now he had to go to the hearing to tell them about my arm about how i couldnt use it for three months crabbe and goyle sniggered i really wish i could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend himself theres no arm in im onest that hippogriffs as good as dead malfoy suddenly caught sight of ron his pale face split in a malevolent grin what are you doing weasley malfoy looked up at the crumbling house behind ron suppose youd love to live here wouldnt you weasley dreaming about having your own bedroom i heard your family all sleep in one room is that true harry seized the back of rons robes to stop him from leaping on malfoy leave him to me he hissed in rons ear the opportunity was too perfect to miss harry crept silently around behind malfoy crabbe and goyle bent down and scooped a large handful of mud out of the path we were just discussing your friend hagrid malfoy said to ron just trying to imagine what hes saying to the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures dyou think hell cry when they cut off his hippogriffs splat malfoys head jerked forward as the mud hit him his silverblond hair was suddenly dripping in muck what the ron had to hold onto the fence to keep himself standing he was laughing so hard malfoy crabbe and goyle spun stupidly on the spot staring wildly around malfoy trying to wipe his hair clean what was that who did that very haunted up here isnt it said ron with the air of one commenting on the weather crabbe and goyle were looking scared their bulging muscles were no use against ghosts malfoy was staring madly around at the deserted landscape harry sneaked along the path where a particularly sloppy puddle yielded some foulsmelling green sludge splatter crabbe and goyle caught some this time goyle hopped furiously on the spot trying to rub it out of his small dull eyes it came from over there said malfoy wiping his face and staring at a spot some six feet to the left of harry crabbe blundered forward his long arms outstretched like a zombie harry dodged around him picked up a stick and lobbed it at crabbes back harry doubled up with silent laughter as crabbe did a kind of pirouette in midair trying to see who had thrown it as ron was the only person crabbe could see it was ron he started toward but harry stuck out his leg crabbe stumbled and his huge flat foot caught the hem of harrys cloak harry felt a great tug then the cloak slid off his face for a split second malfoy stared at him aaargh he yelled pointing at harrys head then he turned tail and ran at breakneck speed back down the hill crabbe and goyle behind him harry tugged the cloak up again but the damage was done harry ron said stumbling forward and staring hopelessly at the point where harry had disappeared youd better run for it if malfoy tells anyone youd better get back to the castle quick see you later said harry and without another word he tore back down the path toward hogsmeade would malfoy believe what he had seen would anyone believe malfoy nobody knew about the invisibility cloak nobody except dumbledore harrys stomach turned over dumbledore would know exactly what had happened if malfoy said any thing back into honeydukes back down the cellar steps across the stone floor through the trapdoor harry pulled off the cloak tucked it under his arm and ran flat out along the passage malfoy would get back first how long would it take him to find a teacher panting a sharp pain in his side harry didnt slow down until he reached the stone slide he would have to leave the cloak where it was it was too much of a giveaway in case malfoy had tipped off a teacher he hid it in a shadowy corner then started to climb fast as he could his sweaty hands slipping on the sides of the chute he reached the inside of the witchs hump tapped it with his wand stuck his head through and hoisted himself out the hump closed and just as harry jumped out from behind the statue he heard quick footsteps approaching it was snape he approached harry at a swift walk his black robes swishing then stopped in front of him so he said there was a look of surpressed triumph about him harry tried to look innocent all too aware of his sweaty face and his muddy hands which he quickly hid in his pockets come with me potter said snape harry followed him downstairs trying to wipe his hands clean on the inside of his robes without snape noticing they walked down the stairs to the dungeons and then into snapes office harry had been in here only once before and he had been in very serious trouble then too snape had aquired a few more slimy horrible things in jars since last time all standing on shelves behind his desk glinting in the firelight and adding to the threatening atmosphere sit said snape harry sat snape however remained standing mr malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story potter said snape harry didnt say anything he tells me that he was up by the shrieking shack when he ran into weasley apparently alone still harry didnt speak mr malfoy states that he was standing talking to weasley when a large amount of mud hit him in the back of the head how do you think that could have happened harry tried to look mildly surprised i dont know professor snapes eyes were boring into harrys it was exactly like trying to stare down a hippogriff harry tried hard not to blink mr malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition can you imagine what it might have been potter no said harry now trying to sound innocently curious it was your head potter floating in midair there was a long silence maybe hed better go to madam pomfrey said harry if hes seeing things like what would your head have been doing in hogsmeade potter said snape softly your head is not allowed in hogsmeade no part of your body has permission to be in hogsmeade i know that said harry striving to keep his face free of guilt or fear it sounds like malfoys having hallucin malfoy is not having hallucinations snarled snape and he bent down a hand on each arm of harrys chair so that their faces were a foot apart if your head was in hogsmeade so was the rest of you ive been up in gryffindor tower said harry like you told can anyone confirm that harry didnt say anything snapes thin mouth curled into a horrible smile so he said straightening up again everyone from the minister of magic downward has been trying to keep famous harry potter safe from sirius black but famous harry potter is a law unto himself let the ordinary people worry about his safety famous harry potter goes where he wants to with no thought for the consequences harry stayed silent snape was trying to provoke him into telling the truth he wasnt going to do it snape had no proof yet how extraordinarily like your father you are potter snape said suddenly his eyes glinting he too was exceedingly arrogant a small amount of talent on the quidditch field made him think he was a cut above the rest of us too strutting around the place with his friends and admirers the resemblance between you is uncanny my dad didnt strut said harry before he could stop himself and neither do i your father didnt set much store by rules either snape went on pressing his advantage his thin face full of malice rules were for lesser mortals not quidditch cupwinners his head was so swollen shut up harry was suddenly on his feet rage such as he had not felt since his last night in privet drive was coursing through him he didnt care that snapes face had gone rigid the black eyes flashing dangerously what did you say to me potter i told you to shut up about my dad harry yelled i know the truth all right he saved your life dumbledore told me you wouldnt even be here if it wasnt for my dad snapes sallow skin had gone the color of sour milk and did the headmaster tell you the circumstances in which your father saved my life he whispered or did he consider the details too unpleasant for precious potters delicate ears harry bit his lip he didnt know what had happened and didnt want to admit it but snape seemed to have guessed the truth i would hate for you to run away with a false idea of your father potter he said a terrible grin twisting his face have you been imagining some act of glorious heroism then let me correct you your saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that would have resulted in my death if your father hadnt got cold feet at the last moment there was nothing brave about what he did he was saving his own skin as much as mine had their joke succeeded he would have been expelled from hogwarts snapes uneven yellowish teeth were bared turn out your pockets potter he spat suddenly harry didnt move there was a pounding in his ears turn out your pockets or we go straight to the headmaster pull them out potter cold with dread harry slowly pulled out the bag of zonkos tricks and the marauders map snape picked up the zonkos bag ron gave them to me said harry praying hed get a chance to tip ron off before snape saw him he brought them back from hogsmeade last time indeed and youve been carrying them around ever since how very touching and what is this snape had picked up the map harry tried with all his might to keep his face impassive spare bit of parchment he said with a shrug snape turned it over his eyes on harry surely you dont need such a very old piece of parchment he said why dont i just throw this away his hand moved toward the fire no harry said quickly so said snape his long nostrils quivering is this another treasured gift from mr weasley or is it something else a letter perhaps written in invisible ink or instructions to get into hogsmeade without passing the dementors harry blinked snapes eyes gleamed let me see let me see he muttered taking out his wand and smoothing the map out on his desk reveal your secret he said touching the wand to the parchment nothing happened harry clenched his hands to stop them from shaking show yourself snape said tapping the map sharply it stayed blank harry was taking deep calming breaths professor severus snape master of this school commands you to yield the information you conceal snape said hitting the map with his wand as though an invisible hand were writing upon it words appeared on the smooth surface of the map moony presents his compliments to professor snape and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other peoples business snape froze harry stared dumbstruck at the message but the map didnt stop there more writing was appearing beneath the first mr prongs agrees with mr moony and would like to add that professor snape is an ugly git it would have been very funny if the situation hadnt been so serious and there was more mr padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like that ever became a professor harry closed his eyes in horror when hed opened them the map had had its last word mr wormtail bids professor snape good day and advises him to wash his hair the slimeball harry waited for the blow to fall so said snape softly well see about this he strode across to his fire seized a fistful of glittering powder from a jar on the fireplace and threw it into the flames lupin snape called into the fire i want a word utterly bewildered harry stared at the fire a large shape had appeared in it revolving very fast seconds later professor lupin was clambering out of the fireplace brushing ash off his shabby robes you called severus said lupin mildly i certainly did said snape his face contorted with fury as he strode back to his desk i have just asked potter to empty his pockets he was carrying this snape pointed at the parchment on which the words of masters moony wormtail padfoot and prongs were still shining an odd closed expression appeared on lupins face well said snape lupin continued to stare at the map harry had the impression that lupin was doing some very quick thinking well said snape again this parchment is plainly full of dark magic this is supposed to be your area of expertise lupin where do you imagine potter got such a thing lupin looked up and by the merest halfglance in harrys direction warned him not to interrupt full of dark magic he repeated mildly do you really think so severus it looks to me as though it is merely a piece of parchment that insults anybody who reads it childish but surely not dangerous i imagine harry got it from a joke shop indeed said snape his jaw had gone rigid with anger you think a joke shop could supply him with such a thing you dont think it more likely that he got it directly from the manufacturers harry didnt understand what snape was talking about nor apparently did lupin you mean by mr wormtail or one of these people he said harry do you know any of these men no said harry quickly you see severus said lupin turning back to snape it looks like a zonko product to me right on cue ron came bursting into the office he was completely out of breath and stopped just short of snapes desk clutching the stitch in his chest and trying to speak i gave harry that stuff he choked bought it in zonkos ages ago well said lupin clapping his hands together and looking around cheerfully that seems to clear that up severus ill take this back shall i he folded the map and tucked it inside his robes harry ron come with me i need a word about my vampire essay excuse us severus harry didnt dare look at snape as they left his office he ron and lupin walked all the way back into the entrance hall before speaking then harry turned to lupin professor i i dont want to hear explanations said lupin shortly he glanced around the empty entrance hall and lowered his voice i happen to know that this map was confiscated by mr filch many years ago yes i know it s a map he said as harry and ron looked amazed i dont want to know how it fell into your possession i am however astounded that you didnt hand it in particularly after what happened the last time a student left information about the castle lying around and i cant let you have it back harry harry had expected that and was too keen for explanations to protest why did snape think id got it from the manufacturers because lupin hesitated because these mapmakers would have wanted to lure you out of school theyd think it extremely entertaining do you know them said harry impressed weve met he said shortly he was looking at harry more seriously than ever before dont expect me to cover up for you again harry i cannot make you take sirius black seriously but i would have thought that what you have heard when the dementors draw near you would have had more of an effect on you your parents gave their lives to keep you alive harry a poor way to repay them gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic tricks he walked away leaving harry feeling worse by far than he had at any point in snapes office slowly he and ron mounted the marble staircase as harry passed the oneeyed witch he remembered the invisibility cloak it was still down there but he didnt dare go and get it its my fault said ron abruptly i persuaded you to go lupins right it was stupid we shouldntve done it he broke off they reached the corridor where the security trolls were pacing and hermione was walking toward them one look at her face convinced harry that she had heard what had happened his heart plummeted had she told professor mcgonagall come to have a good gloat said ron savagely as she stopped in front of them or have you just been to tell on us no said hermione she was holding a letter in her hands and her lip was trembling i just thought you ought to know hagrid lost his case buckbeak is going to be executed chapter fifteen the quidditch final he sent me this hermione said holding out the letter harry took it the parchment was damp and enormous teardrops had smudged the ink so badly in places that it was very difficult to read dear hermione we lost im allowed to bring him back to hogwarts execution date to be fixed beaky has enjoyed london i wont forget all the help you gave us hagrid they cant do this said harry they cant buckbeak isnt dangerous malfoys dads frightened the committee into it said hermione wiping her eyes you know what hes like theyre a bunch of doddery old fools and they were scared therell be an appeal though there always is only i cant see any hope nothing will have changed yeah it will said ron fiercely you wont have to do all the work alone this time hermione ill help oh ron hermione flung her arms around rons neck and broke down completely ron looking quite terrified patted her very awkwardly on the top of the head finally hermione drew away ron im really really sorry about scabbers she sobbed oh well he was old said ron looking thoroughly relieved that she had let go of him and he was a bit useless you never know mum and dad might get me an owl now the safety measures imposed on the students since blacks second breakin made it impossible for harry ron and hermione to go and visit hagrid in the evenings their only chance of talking to him was during care of magical creatures lessons he seemed numb with shock at the verdict sall my fault got all tonguetied they was all sittin there in black robes an i kep droppin me notes and forgettin all them dates yeh looked up fer me hermione an then lucius malfoy stood up an said his bit and the committee jus did exacly what he told em theres still the appeal said ron fiercely dont give up yet were working on it they were walking back up to the castle with the rest of the class ahead they could see malfoy who was walking with crabbe and goyle and kept looking back laughing derisively sno good ron said hagrid sadly as they reached the castle steps that committees in lucius malfoys pocket im jus gonna make sure the rest o beakys time is the happiest hes ever had i owe him that hagrid turned around and hurried back toward his cabin his face buried in his handkerchief look at him blubber malfoy crabbe and goyle had been standing just inside the castle doors listening have you ever seen anything quite as pathetic said malfoy and hes supposed to be our teacher harry and ron both made furious moves toward malfoy but hermione got there first smack she had slapped malfoy across the face with all the strength she could muster malfoy staggered harry ron crabbe and goyle stood flabbergasted as hermione raised her hand again dont you dare call hagrid pathetic you foul you evil hermione said ron weakly and he tried to grab her hand as she swung it back get off ron hermione pulled out her wand malfoy stepped backward crabbe and goyle looked at him for instructions thoroughly bewildered cmon malfoy muttered and in a moment all three of them had disappeared into the passageway to the dungeons hermione ron said again sounding both stunned and impressed harry youd better beat him in the quidditch final hermione said shrilly you just better had because i cant stand it if slytherin wins were due in charms said ron still goggling at hermione wed better go they hurried up the marble staircase toward professor flitwicks classroom youre late boys said professor flitwick reprovingly as harry opened the classroom door come along quickly wands out were experimenting with cheering charms today weve already divided into pairs harry and ron hurried to a desk at the back and opened their bags ron looked behind him wheres hermione gone harry looked around too hermione hadnt entered the classroom yet harry knew she had been right next to him when he had opened the door thats weird said harry staring at ron maybe maybe she went to the bathroom or something but hermione didnt turn up all lesson she couldve done with a cheering charm on her too said ron as the class left for lunch all grinning broadly the cheering charms had left them with a feeling of great contentment hermione wasnt at lunch either by the time they had finished their apple pie the aftereffects of the cheering charms were wearing off and harry and ron had started to get slightly worried you dont think malfoy did something to her ron said anxiously as they hurried upstairs toward gryffindor tower they passed the security trolls gave the fat lady the password flibbertigibbet and scrambled through the portrait hole into the common room hermione was sitting at a table fast asleep her head resting on an open arithmancy book they went to sit down on either side of her harry prodded her awake wh what said hermione waking with a start and staring wildly around is it time to go w which lesson have we got now divination but its not for another twenty minutes said harry hermione why didnt you come to charms what oh no hermione squeaked i forgot to go to charms but how could you forget said harry you were with us till we were right outside the classroom i dont believe it hermione wailed was professor flitwick angry oh it was malfoy i was thinking about him and i lost track of things you know what hermione said ron looking down at the enormous arithmancy book hermione had been using as a pillow i reckon youre cracking up youre trying to do too much no im not said hermione brushing her hair out of her eyes and staring hopelessly around for her bag i just made a mistake thats all id better go and see professor flitwick and say sorry ill see you in divination hermione joined them at the foot of the ladder to professor trelawneys classroom twenty minutes later looking extremely harrassed i cant believe i missed cheering charms and i bet they come up in our exams professor flitwick hinted they might together they climbed the ladder into the dim stifling tower room glowing on every little table was a crystal ball full of pearly white mist harry ron and hermione sat down together at the same rickety table i thought we werent starting crystal balls until next term ron muttered casting a wary eye around for professor trelawney in case she was lurking nearby dont complain this means weve finished palmistry harry muttered back i was getting sick of her flinching every time she looked at my hands good day to you said the familiar misty voice and professor trelawney made her usual dramatic entrance out of the shadows parvati and lavender quivered with excitement their faces lit by the milky glow of their crystal ball i have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than i had planned said professor trelawney sitting with her back to the fire and gazing around the fates have informed me that your examination in june will concern the orb and i am anxious to give you sufficient practice hermione snorted well honestly the fates have informed her who sets the exam she does what an amazing prediction she said not troubling to keep her voice low harry and ron choked back laughs it was hard to tell whether professor trelawney had heard them as her face was hidden in shadow she continued however as though she had not crystal gazing is a particularly refined art she said dreamily i do not expect any of you to see when first you peer into the orbs infinite depths we shall start by practicing relaxing the conscious mind and external eyes ron began to snigger uncontrollably and had to stuff his fist in his mouth to stifle the noise so as to clear the inner eye and the superconscious perhaps if we are lucky some of you will see before the end of the class and so they began harry at least felt extremely foolish staring blankly at the crystal ball trying to keep his mind empty when thoughts such as this is stupid kept drifting across it it didnt help that ron kept breaking into silent giggles and hermione kept tutting seen anything yet harry asked them after a quarter of an hours quiet crystal gazing yeah theres a burn on this table said ron pointing someones spilled their candle this is such a waste of time hermione hissed i could be practicing something useful i could be catching up on cheering charms professor trelawney rustled past would anyone like me to help them interpret the shadowy portents within their orb she murmured over the clinking of her bangles i dont need help ron whispered its obvious what this means theres going to be loads of fog tonight both harry and hermione burst out laughing now really said professor trelawney as everyones heads turned in their direction parvati and lavender were looking scandalized you are disturbing the clairvoyant vibrations she approached their table and peered into their crystal ball harry felt his heart sinking he was sure he knew what was coming there is something here professor trelawney whispered lowering her face to the ball so that it was reflected twice in her huge glasses something moving but what is it harry was prepared to bet everything he owned including his firebolt that it wasnt good news whatever it was and sure enough my dear professor trelawney breathed gazing up at harry it is here plainer than ever before my dear stalking toward you growing ever closer the gr oh for goodness sake said hermione loudly not that ridiculous grim again professor trelawney raised her enormous eyes to hermiones face parvati whispered something to lavender and they both glared at hermione too professor trelawney stood up surveying hermione with unmistakable anger i am sorry to say that from the moment you have arrived in this class my dear it has been apparent that you do not have what the noble art of divination requires indeed i dont remember ever meeting a student whose mind was so hopelessly mundane there was a moments silence then fine said hermione suddenly getting up and cramming unfogging the future back into her bag fine she repeated swinging the bag over her shoulder and almost knocking ron off his chair i give up im leaving and to the whole classs amazement hermione strode over to the trapdoor kicked it open and climbed down the ladder out of sight it took a few minutes for the class to settle down again professor trelawney seemed to have forgotten all about the grim she turned abruptly from harry and rons table breathing rather heavily as she tugged her gauzy shawl more closely to her ooooo said lavender suddenly making everyone start ooooo professor trelawney ive just remembered you saw her leaving didnt you didnt you professor around easter one of our number will leave us forever you said it ages ago professor professor trelawney gave her a dewy smile yes my dear i did indeed know that miss granger would be leaving us one hopes however that one might have mistaken the signs the inner eye can be a burden you know lavender and parvati looked deeply impressed and moved over so that professor trelawney could join their table instead some day hermiones having eh ron muttered to harry looking awed yeah harry glanced into the crystal ball but saw nothing but swirling white mist had professor trelawney really seen the grim again would he the last thing he needed was another nearfatal accident with the quidditch final drawing ever nearer the easter holidays were not exactly relaxing the third years had never had so much homework neville longbottom seemed close to a nervous collapse and he wasnt the only one call this a holiday seamus finnigan roared at the common room one afternoon the exams are ages away whatre they playing at but nobody had as much to do as hermione even without divination she was taking more subjects than anybody else she was usually last to leave the common room at night first to arrive at the library the next morning she had shadows like lupins under her eyes and seemed constantly close to tears ron had taken over responsibility for buckbeaks appeal when he wasnt doing his own work he was poring over enormously thick volumes with names like the handbook of hippogriff psychology and fowl or foul a study of hippogriff brutality he was so absorbed he even forgot to be horrible to crookshanks harry meanwhile had to fit in his homework around quidditch practice every day not to mention endless discussions of tactics with wood the gryffindorslytherin match would take place on the first saturday after the easter holidays slytherin was leading the tournament by exactly two hundred points this meant as wood constantly reminded his team that they needed to win the match by more than that amount to win the cup it also meant that the burden of winning fell largely on harry because capturing the snitch was worth one hundred and fifty points so you must catch it only if were more than fifty points up wood told harry constantly only if were more than fifty points up harry or we win the match but lose the cup youve got that havent you you must catch the snitch only if were i know oliver harry yelled the whole of gryffindor house was obsessed with the coming match gryffindor hadnt won the quidditch cup since the legendary charlie weasley rons second oldest brother had been seeker but harry doubted whether any of them even wood wanted to win as much as he did the enmity between harry and malfoy was at its highest point ever malfoy was still smarting bout the mudthrowing incident in hogsmeade and was even more furious that harry had somehow wormed his way out of punishment harry hadnt forgotten malfoys attempt to sabotage him in the match against ravenclaw but it was the matter of buckbeak that made him most determined to beat malfoy in front of the entire school never in anyones memory had a match approached in such a highly charged atmosphere by the time the holidays were over tension between the two teams and their houses was at the breaking point a number of small scuffles broke out in the corridors culminating in a nasty incident in which a gryffindor fourth year and a slytherin sixth year ended up in the hospital wing with leeks sprouting out of their ears harry was having a particularly bad time of it he couldnt walk to class without slytherins sticking out their legs and trying to trip him up crabbe and goyle kept popping up wherever he went and slouching away looking disappointed when they saw him surrounded by people wood had given instructions that harry should be accompanied everywhere he went in case the slytherins tried to put him out of action the whole of gryffindor house took up the challenge enthusiastically so that it was impossible for harry to get to classes on time because he was surrounded by a vast chattering crowd harry was more concerned for his firebolts safety than his own when he wasnt flying it he locked it securely in his trunk and frequently dashed back up to gryffindor tower at break times to check that it was still there all usual pursuits were abandoned in the gryffindor common room the night before the match even hermione had put down her books i cant work i cant concentrate she said nervously there was a great deal of noise fred and george weasley were dealing with the pressure by being louder and more exuberant than ever oliver wood was crouched over a model of a quidditch field in the corner prodding little figures across it with his wand and muttering to himself angelina alicia and katie were laughing at freds and georges jokes harry was sitting with ron and hermione removed from the center of things trying not to think about the next day because every time he did he had the horrible sensation that something very large was fighting to get out of his stomach youre going to be fine hermione told him though she looked positively terrified youve got a firebolt said ron yeah said harry his stomach writhing it came as a relief when wood suddenly stood up and yelled team bed harry slept badly first he dreamed that he had overslept and that wood was yelling where were you we had to use neville instead then he dreamed that malfoy and the rest of the slytherin team arrived for the match riding dragons he was flying at breakneck speed trying to avoid a spurt of flames from malfoys steeds mouth when he realized he had forgotten his firebolt he fell through the air and woke with a start it was a few seconds before harry remembered that the match hadnt taken place yet that he was safe in bed and that the slytherin team definitely wouldnt be allowed to play on dragons he was feeling very thirsty quietly as he could he got out of his fourposter and went to pour himself some water from the silver jug beneath the window the grounds were still and quiet no breath of wind disturbed the treetops in the forbidden forest the whomping willow was motionless and innocentlooking it looked as though the conditions for the match would be perfect harry set down his goblet and was about to turn back to his bed when something caught his eye an animal of some kind was prowling across the silvery lawn harry dashed to his bedside table snatched up his glasses and put them on then hurried back to the window it couldnt be the grim not now not right before the match he peered out at the grounds again and after a minutes frantic searching spotted it it was skirting the edge of the forest now it wasnt the grim at all it was a cat harry clutched the window ledge in relief as he recognized the bottlebrush tail it was only crookshanks or was it only crookshanks harry squinted pressing his nose flat against the glass crookshanks seemed to have come to a halt harry was sure he could see something else moving in the shadow of the trees too and just then it emerged a gigantic shaggy black dog moving stealthily across the lawn crookshanks trotting at its side harry stared what did this mean if crookshanks could see the dog as well how could it be an omen of harrys death ron harry hissed ron wake up huh i need you to tell me if you can see something sall dark harry ron muttered thickly whatre you about down here harry looked quickly back out of the window crookshanks and the dog had vanished harry climbed onto the windowsill to look right down into the shadows of the castle but they werent there where had they gone a loud snore told him ron had fallen asleep again harry and the rest of the gryffindor team entered the great hall the next day to enormous applause harry couldnt help grinning broadly as he saw that both the ravenclaw and hufflepuff tables were applauding them too the slytherin table hissed loudly as they passed harry noticed that malfoy looked even paler than usual wood spent the whole of breakfast urging his team to eat while touching nothing himself then he hurried them off to the field before anyone else had finished so they could get an idea of the conditions as they left the great hall everyone applauded again good luck harry called cho harry felt himself blushing okay no wind to speak of suns a bit bright that could impair your vision watch out for it grounds fairly hard good thatll give us a fast kickoff wood paced the field staring around with the team behind him finally they saw the front doors of the castle open in the distance and the rest of the school spilling onto the lawn locker rooms said wood tersely none of them spoke as they changed into their scarlet robes harry wondered if they were feeling like he was as though hed eaten something extremely wriggly for breakfast in what seemed like no time at all wood was saying okay its time lets go they walked out onto the field to a tidal wave of noise threequarters of the crowd was wearing scarlet rosettes waving scarlet flags with the gryffindor lion upon them or brandishing banners with slogans like go gryffindor and lions for the cup behind the slytherin goal posts however two hundred people were wearing green the silver serpent of slytherin glittered on their flags and professor snape sat in the very front row wearing green like everyone else and a very grim smile and here are the gryffindors yelled lee jordan who was acting as commentator as usual potter bell johnson spinnet weasley weasley and wood widely acknowledged as the best team hogwarts has seen in a good few years lees comments were drowned by a tide of boos from the slytherin end and here come the slytherin team led by captain flint hes made some changes in the lineup and seems to be going for size rather than skill more boos from the slytherin crowd harry however thought lee had a point malfoy was easily the smallest person on the slytherin team the rest of them were enormous captains shake hands said madam hooch flint and wood approached each other and grasped each others hand very tightly it looked as though each was trying to break the others fingers mount your brooms said madam hooch three two one the sound of her whistle was lost in the roar from the crowd as fourteen brooms rose into the air harry felt his hair fly back off his forehead his nerves left him in the thrill of the flight he glanced around saw malfoy on his tail and sped off in search of the snitch and its gryffindor in possession alicia spinner of gryffindor with the quaffle heading straight for the slytherin goal posts looking good alicia argh no quaffle intercepted by warrington warrington of slytherin tearing up the field wham nice bludger work there by george weasley warrington drops the quaffle its caught by johnson gryffindor back in possession come on angelina nice swerve around montague duck angelina thats a bludgershe scores tenzero to gryffindor angelina punched the air as she soared around the end of the field the sea of scarlet below was screaming its delight ouch angelina was nearly thrown from her broom as marcus flint went smashing into her sorry said flint as the crowd below booed sorry didnt see her a moment later fred weasley chucked his beaters club at the back of flints head flints nose smashed into the handle of his broom and began to bleed that will do shrieked madam hooch zooming between then penalty shot to gryffindor for an unprovoked attack on their chaser penalty shot to slytherin for deliberate damage to their chaser come off it miss howled fred but madam hooch blew her whistle and alicia flew forward to take the penalty come on alicia yelled lee into the silence that had descended on the crowd yes shes beaten the keeper twentyzero to gryffindor harry turned the firebolt sharply to watch flint still bleeding freely fly forward to take the slytherin penalty wood was hovering in front of the gryffindor goal posts his jaw clenched course woods a superb keeper lee jordan told the crowd as flint waited for madam hoochs whistle superb very difficult to pass very difficult indeed yes i dont believe it hes saved it relieved harry zoomed away gazing around for the snitch but still making sure he caught every word of lees commentary it was essential that he hold malfoy off the snitch until gryffindor was more than fifty points up gryffindor in possession no slytherin in possession no gryffindor back in possession and its katie bell katie bell for gryffindor with the quaffle shes streaking up the field that was deliberate montague a slytherin chaser had swerved in front of katie and instead of seizing the quaffle had grabbed her head katie cart wheeled in the air managed to stay on her broom but dropped the quaffle madam hoochs whistle rang out again as she soared over to montague and began shouting at him a minute later katie had put another penalty past the slytherin seeker thirtyzero take that you dirty cheating jordan if you cant commentate in an unbiased way im telling it like it is professor harry felt a huge jolt of excitement he had seen the snitch it was shimmering at the foot of one of the gryffindor goal posts but he mustnt catch it yet and if malfoy saw it faking a look of sudden concentration harry pulled his firebolt around and sped off toward the slytherin end it worked malfoy went haring after him clearly thinking harry had seen the snitch there whoosh one of the bludgers came streaking past harrys right ear hit by the gigantic slytherin beater derrick then again whoosh the second bludger grazed harrys elbow the other beater bole was closing in harry had a fleeting glimpse of bole and derrick zooming toward him clubs raised he turned the firebolt upward at the last second and bole and derrick collided with a sickening crunch ha haaa yelled lee jordan as the slytherin beaters lurched away from each other clutching their heads too bad boys youll need to get up earlier than that to beat a firebolt and its gryffindor in possession again as johnson takes the quaffle flint alongside her poke him in the eye angelina it was a joke professor it was a joke oh no flint in possession flint flying toward the gryffindor goal posts come on now wood save but flint had scored there was an eruption of cheers from the slytherin end and lee swore so badly that professor mcgonagall tried to tug the magical megaphone away from him sorry professor sorry wont happen again so gryffindor in the lead thirty points to ten and gryffindor in possession it was turning into the dirtiest game harry had ever played in enraged that gryffindor had taken such an early lead the slytherins were rapidly resorting to any means to take the quaffle bole hit alicia with his club and tried to say hed thought she was a bludger george weasley elbowed bole in the face in retaliation madam hooch awarded both teams penalties and wood pulled off another spectacular save making the score fortyten to gryffindor the snitch had disappeared again malfoy was still keeping close to harry as he soared over the match looking around for it once gryffindor was fifty points ahead katie scored fiftyten fred and george weasley were swooping around her clubs raised in case any of the slytherins were thinking of revenge bole and derrick took advantage of freds and georges absence to aim both bludgers at wood they caught him in the stomach one after the other and he rolled over in the air clutching his broom completely winded madam hooch was beside herself you do not attack the keeper unless the quaffle is within the scoring area she shrieked at bole and derrick gryffindor penalty and angelina scored sixtyten moments later fred weasley pelted a bludger at warrington knocking the quaffle out of his hands alicia seized it and put it through the slytherin goal seventyten the gryffindor crowd below was screaming itself hoarse gryffindor was sixty points in the lead and if harry caught the snitch now the cup was theirs harry could almost feel hundreds of eyes following him as he soared around the field high above the rest of the game with malfoy speeding along behind him and then he saw it the snitch was sparkling twenty feet above him harry put on a huge burst of speed the wind was roaring in his ears he stretched out his hand but suddenly the firebolt was slowing down horrified he looked around malfoy had thrown himself forward grabbed hold of the firebolts tail and was pulling it back you harry was angry enough to hit malfoy but couldnt reach malfoy was panting with the effort of holding onto the firebolt but his eyes were sparkling maliciously he had achieved what hed wanted to do the snitch had disappeared again penalty penalty to gryffindor ive never seen such tactics madam hooch screeched shooting up to where malfoy was sliding back onto his nimbus two thousand and one you cheating scum lee jordan was howling into the megaphone dancing out of professor mcgonagalls reach you filthy cheating b professor mcgonagall didnt even bother to tell him off she was actually shaking her finger in malfoys direction her hat had fallen off and she too was shouting furiously alicia took gryffindors penalty but she was so angry she missed by several feet the gryffindor team was losing concentration and the slytherins delighted by malfoys foul on harry were being spurred on to greater heights slytherin in possession slytherin heading for goal montague scores lee groaned seventy twenty to gryffindor harry was now marking malfoy so closely their knees kept hitting each other harry wasnt going to let malfoy anywhere near the snitch get out of it potter malfoy yelled in frustration as he tried to turn and found harry blocking him angelina johnson gets the quaffle for gryffindor come on angelina come on harry looked around every single slytherin player apart from malfoy was streaking up the pitch toward angelina including the slytherin keeper they were all going to block her harry wheeled the firebolt around bent so low he was lying flat along the handle and kicked it forward like a bullet he shot toward the slytherins aaaaaaarrrgh they scattered as the firebolt zoomed toward them angelinas way was clear she scores she scores gryffindor leads by eighty points to twenty harry who had almost pelted headlong into the stands skidded to a halt in midair reversed and zoomed back into the middle of the field and then he saw something to make his heart stand still malfoy was diving a look of triumph on his face there a few feet above the grass below was a tiny golden glimmer harry urged the firebolt downward but malfoy was miles ahead go go go harry urged his broom he was gaining on malfoy harry flattened himself to the broom handle as bole sent a bludger at him he was at malfoys ankles he was level harry threw himself forward took both hands off his broom he knocked malfoys arm out of the way and yes he pulled out of his dive his hand in the air and the stadium exploded harry soared above the crowd an odd ringing in his ears the tiny golden ball was held tight in his fist beating its wings hopelessly against his fingers then wood was speeding toward him halfblinded by tears he seized harry around the neck and sobbed unrestrainedly into his shoulder harry felt two large thumps as fred and george hit them then angelinas alicias and katies voices weve won the cup weve won the cup tangled together in a manyarmed hug the gryffindor team sank yelling hoarsely back to earth wave upon wave of crimson supporters was pouring over the barriers onto the field hands were raining down on their backs harry had a confused impression of noise and bodies pressing in on him then he and the rest of the team were hoisted onto the shoulders of the crowd thrust into the light he saw hagrid plastered with crimson rosettes yeh beat em harry yeh beat em wait till i tell buckbeak there was percy jumping up and down like a maniac all dignity forgotten professor mcgonagall was sobbing harder even than wood wiping her eyes with an enormous gryffindor flag and there fighting their way toward harry were ron and hermione words failed them they simply beamed as harry was borne toward the stands where dumbledore stood waiting with the enormous quidditch cup if only there had been a dementor around as a sobbing wood passed harry the cup as he lifted it into the air harry felt he could have produced the worlds best patronus chapter sixteen professor trelawneys prediction harrys euphoria at finally winning the quidditch cup lasted at least a week even the weather seemed to be celebrating as june approached the days became cloudless and sultry and all anybody felt like doing was strolling onto the grounds and flopping down on the grass with several pints of iced pumpkin juice perhaps playing a casual game of gobstones or watching the giant squid propel itself dreamily across the surface of the lake but they couldnt exams were nearly upon them and instead of lazing around outside the students were forced to remain inside the castle trying to bully their brains into concentrating while enticing wafts of summer air drifted in through the windows even fred and george weasley had been spotted working they were about to take their owls ordinary wizarding levels percy was getting ready to take his newts nastily exhausting wizarding tests the highest qualification hogwarts offered as percy hoped to enter the ministry of magic he needed top grades he was becoming increasingly edgy and gave very severe punishments to anybody who disturbed the quiet of the common room in the evenings in fact the only person who seemed more anxious than percy was hermione harry and ron had given up asking her how she was managing to attend several classes at once but they couldnt restrain themselves when they saw the exam schedule she had drawn up for herself the first column read monday 9 oclock arithmancy 9 oclock transfiguration lunch 1 oclock charms 1 oclock ancient runes hermione ron said cautiously because she was liable to explode when interrupted these days er are you sure youve copied down these times right what snapped hermione picking up the exam schedule and examining it yes of course i have is there any point asking how youre going to sit for two exams at once said harry no said hermione shortly have either of you seen my copy of numerology and gramatica oh yeah i borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading said ron but very quietly hermione started shifting heaps of parchment harry ron and hermione plenty of opportunity to speak to hagrid beakys gettin a bit depressed hagrid told them bending low on the pretense of checking that harrys flobberworm was still alive bin cooped up too long but still well know day after tomorrow one way or the other they had potions that afternoon which was an unqualified disaster try as harry might he couldnt get his confusing concoction to thicken and snape standing watch with an air of vindictive pleasure scribbled something that looked suspiciously like a zero onto his notes before moving away then came astronomy at midnight up on the tallest tower history of magic on wednesday morning in which harry scribbled everything florean fortescue had ever told him about medieval witchhunts while wishing he could have had one of fortescues choconut sundaes with him in the stifling classroom wednesday afternoon meant herbology in the greenhouses under a bakinghot sun then back to the common room once more with sunburnt necks thinking longingly of this time next day when it would all be over their second to last exam on thursday morning was defense against the dark arts professor lupin had compiled the most unusual exam any of them had ever taken a sort of obstacle course outside in the sun where they had to wade across a deep paddling pool containing a grindylow cross a series of potholes full of red caps squish their way across a patch of marsh while ignoring misleading directions from a hinkypunk then climb into an old trunk and battle with a new boggart excellent harry lupin muttered as harry climbed out of the trunk grinning full marks flushed with his success harry hung around to watch ron and hermione ron did very well until he reached the hinkypunk which successfully confused him into sinking waisthigh into the quagmire hermione did everything perfectly until she reached the trunk with the boggart in it after about a minute inside it she burst out again screaming hermione said lupin startled whats the matter p p professor mcgonagall hermione gasped pointing into the trunk sh she said id failed everything it took a little while to calm hermione down when at last she had regained a grip on herself she harry and ron went back to the castle ron was still slightly inclined to laugh at hermiones boggart but an argument was averted by the sight that met them on the top of the steps cornelius fudge sweating slightly in his pinstriped cloak was standing there staring out at the grounds he started at the sight of harry hello there harry he said just had an exam i expect nearly finished yes said harry hermione and ron not being on speaking terms with the minister of magic hovered awkwardly in the background lovely day said fudge casting an eye over the lake pity pity he sighed deeply and looked down at harry im here on an unpleasant mission harry the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures required a witness to the execution of a mad hippogriff as i needed to visit hogwarts to check on the black situation i was asked to step in does that mean the appeals already happened ron interrupted stepping forward no no its scheduled for this afternoon said fudge looking curiously at ron then you might not have to witness an execution at all said ron stoutly the hippogriff might get off before fudge could answer two wizards came through the castle doors behind him one was so ancient he appeared to be withering before their very eyes the other was tall and strapping with a thin back mustache harry gathered that they were representatives of the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures because the very old wizard squinted toward hagrids cabin and said in a feeble voice dear dear im getting too old for this two oclock isnt it fudge the blackmustached man was fingering something in his belt harry looked and saw that he was running one broad thumb along the blade of a shining axe ron opened his mouth to say something but hermione nudged him hard in the ribs and jerked her head toward the entrance hall whyd you stop me said ron angrily as they entered the great hall for lunch did you see them theyve even got the axe ready this isnt justice ron your dad works for the ministry you cant go saying things like that to his boss said hermione but she too looked very upset as long as hagrid keeps his head this time and argue his case properly they cant possibly execute buckbeak but harry could tell hermione didnt really believe what she was saying all around them people were talking excitedly as they ate their lunch happily anticipating the end of the exams that afternoon but harry ron and hermione lost in worry about hagrid and buckbeak didnt join in harrys and rons last exam was divination hermiones muggle studies they walked up the marble staircase together hermione left them on the first floor and harry and ron proceeded all the way up to the seventh where many of their class were sitting on the spiral staircase to professor trelawneys classroom trying to cram in a bit of lastminute studying shes seeing us all separately neville informed them as they went to sit down next to him he had his copy of unfogging the future open on his lap at the pages devoted to crystal gazing have either of you ever seen anything in a crystal ball he asked them unhappily nope said ron in an offhand voice he kept checking his watch harry knew that he was counting down the time until buckbeaks appeal started the line of people outside the classroom shortened very slowly as each person climbed back down the silver ladder the rest of the class hissed what did she ask was it okay but they all refused to say she says the crystal balls told her that if i tell you ill have a horrible accident squeaked neville as he clambered back down the ladder toward harry and ron who had now reached the landing thats convenient snorted ron you know im starting to think hermione was right about her he jabbed his thumb toward the trapdoor overhead shes a right old fraud yeah said harry looking at his own watch it was now two oclock wish shed hurry up parvati came back down the ladder glowing with pride she says ive got all the makings of a true seer she informed harry and ron i saw loads of stuff well good luck she hurried off down the spiral staircase toward lavender ronald weasley said the familiar misty voice from over their heads ron grimaced at harry and climbed the silver ladder out of sight harry was now the only person left to be tested he settled himself on the floor with his back against the wall listening to a fly buzzing in the sunny window his mind across the grounds with hagrid finally after about twenty minutes rons large feet reappeared on the ladder howd it go harry asked him standing up rubbish said ron couldnt see a thing so i made some stuff up dont think she was convinced though meet you in the common room harry muttered as professor trelawneys voice called harry potter the tower room was hotter than ever before the curtains were closed the fire was alight and the usual sickly scent made harry cough as he stumbled through the clutter of chairs and table to where professor trelawney sat waiting for him before a large crystal ball good day my dear she said softly if you would kindly gaze into the orb take your time now then tell me what you see within it harry bent over the crystal ball and stared stared as hard as he could willing it to show him something other than swirling white fog but nothing happened well professor trelawney prompted delicately what do you see the heat was overpowering and his nostrils were stinging with the perfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them he thought of what ron had just said and decided to pretend er said harry a dark shape um what does it resemble whispered professor trelawney think now harry cast his mind around and it landed on buckbeak a hippogriff he said firmly indeed whispered professor trelawney scribbling keenly on the parchment perched upon her knees my boy you may well be seeing the outcome of poor hagrids trouble with the ministry of magic look closer does the hippogriff appear to have its head yes said harry firmly are you sure professor trelawney urged him are you quite sure dear you dont see it writhing on the ground perhaps and a shadowy figure raising an axe behind it no said harry starting to feel slightly sick no blood no weeping hagrid no said harry again wanting more than ever to leave the room and the heat it looks fine its flying away professor trelawney sighed well dear i think well leave it there a little disappointing but im sure you did your best relieved harry got up picked up his bag and turned to go but then a loud harsh voice spoke behind him it will happen tonight harry wheeled around professor trelawney had gone rigid in her armchair her eyes were unfocused and her mouth sagging s sorry said harry but professor trelawney didnt seem to hear him her eyes started to roll harry sat there in a panic she looked as though she was about to have some sort of seizure he hesitated thinking of running to the hospital wing and then professor trelawney spoke again in the same harsh voice quite unlike her own the dark lord lies alone and friendless abandoned by his followers his servant has been chained these twelve years tonight before midnight the servant will break free and set out to rejoin his master the dark lord will rise again with his servants aid greater and more terrible than ever he was tonight before midnight the servant will set out to rejoin his master professor trelawneys head fell forward onto her chest she made a grunting sort of noise harry sat there staring at her then quite suddenly professor trelawneys head snapped up again im so sorry dear boy she said dreamily the heat of the day you know i drifted off for a moment harry sat there staring at her is there anything wrong my dear you you just told me that the the dark lords going to rise again that his servants going to go back to him professor trelawney looked thoroughly startled the dark lord hewhomustnotbenamed my dear boy thats hardly something to joke about rise again indeed but you just said it you said the dark lord i think you must have dozed off too dear said professor trelawney i would certainly not presume to predict anything quite as farfetched as that harry climbed back down the ladder and the spiral staircase wondering had he just heard professor trelawney make a real prediction or had that been her idea of an impressive end to the test five minutes later he was dashing past the security trolls outside the entrance to gryffindor tower professor trelawneys words still resounding in his head people were striding past him in the opposite direction laughing and joking heading for the grounds and a bit of longawaited freedom by the time he had reached the portrait hole and entered the common room it was almost deserted over in the corner however sat ron and hermione professor trelawney harry panted just told me but he stopped abruptly at the sight of their faces buckbeak lost said ron weakly hagrids just sent this hagrids note was dry this time no tears had splattered it yet his hand seemed to have shaken so much as he wrote that it was hardly legible lost appeal theyre going to execute at sunset nothing you can do dont come down i dont want you to see it hagrid weve got to go said harry at once he cant just sit there on his own waiting for the executioner sunset though said ron who was staring out the window ill a glazed sort of way wed never be allowed specially you harry harry sank his head into his hands thinking if we only had the invisibility cloak where is it said hermione harry told her about leaving it in the passageway under the oneeyed witch if snape sees me anywhere near there again im in serious trouble he finished thats true said hermione getting to her feet if he sees you how do you open the witchs hump again you you tap it and say dissendium said harry but hermione didnt wait for the rest of his sentence she strode across the room pushed open the fat ladys portrait and vanished from sight she hasnt gone to get it ron said staring after her she had hermione returned a quarter of an hour later with the silvery cloak folded carefully under her robes hermione i dont know whats gotten into you lately said ron astounded first you hit malfoy then you walk out on professor trelawney hermione looked rather flattered they went down to dinner with everybody else but did not return to gryffindor tower afterward harry had the cloak hidden down tie front of his robes he had to keep his arms folded to hide the lump they skulked in an empty chamber off the entrance hall listening until they were sure it was deserted they heard a last pair of people hurrying across the hall and a door slamming hermione poked her head around the door okay she whispered no one there cloak on walking very close together so that nobody would see them they crossed the hall on tiptoe beneath the cloak then walked down the stone front steps into the grounds the sun was already sinking behind the forbidden forest gilding the top branches of the trees they reached hagrids cabin and knocked he was a minute in answering and when he did he looked all around for his visitor palefaced and trembling its us harry hissed were wearing the invisibility cloak let us in and we can take it off yeh shouldnve come hagrid whispered but he stood back and they stepped inside hagrid shut the door quickly and harry pulled off the cloak hagrid was not crying nor did he throw himself upon their necks he looked like a man who did not know where he was or what to do this helplessness was worse to watch than tears wan some tea he said his great hands were shaking as he reached for the kettle wheres buckbeak hagrid said hermione hesitantly i i took him outside said hagrid spilling milk all over the table as he filled up the jug hes tethered in me pumpkin patch thought he oughta see the trees an an smell fresh air before hagrids hand trembled so violently that the milk jug slipped from his grasp and shattered all over the floor ill do it hagrid said hermione quickly hurrying over and starting to clean up the mess theres another one in the cupboard hagrid said sitting down and wiping his forehead on his sleeve harry glanced at ron who looked back hopelessly isnt there anything anyone can do hagrid harry asked fiercely sitting down next to him dumbledore hes tried said hagrid hes got no power ter overrule the committee he told em buckbeaks all right but theyre scared yeh know what lucius malfoys like threatened em i expect an the executioner macnair hes an old pal o malfoys but itll be quick an clean an ill be beside him hagrid swallowed his eyes were darting all over the cabin as though looking for some shred of hope or comfort dumbledores gonna come down while it while it happens wrote me this mornin said he wants ter ter be with me great man dumbledore hermione who had been rummaging in hagrids cupboard for another milk jug let out a small quickly stifled sob she straightened up with the new jug in her hands fighting back tears well stay with you too hagrid she began but hagrid shook his shaggy head yehre ter go back up ter the castle i told yeh i don wan yeh watchin an yeh shouldn be down here anyway if fudge an dumbledore catch yeh out without permission harry yehll be in big trouble silent tears were now streaming down hermiones face but she hid them from hagrid bustling around making tea then as she picked up the milk bottle to pour some into the jug she let out a shriek ron i dont believe it its scabbers ron gaped at her what are you talking about hermione carried the milk jug over to the table and turned it upside down with a frantic squeak and much scrambling to get back inside scabbers the rat came sliding out onto the table scabbers said ron blankly scabbers what are you doing here he grabbed the struggling rat and held him up to the light scabbers looked dreadful he was thinner than ever large tufts of hair had fallen out leaving wide bald patches and he writhed in rons hands as though desperate to free himself its okay scabbers said ron no cats theres nothing here to hurt you hagrid suddenly stood up his eyes fixed on the window his normally ruddy face had gone the color of parchment theyre comin harry ron and hermione whipped around a group of men was walking down the distant castle steps in front was albus dumbledore his silver beard gleaming in the dying sun next to him trotted cornelius fudge behind them came the feeble old committee member and the executioner macnair yeh gotta go said hagrid every inch of him was trembling they mustn find yeh here go now ron stuffed scabbers into his pocket and hermione picked up the cloak ill let yeh out the back way said hagrid they followed him to the door into his back garden harry felt strangely unreal and even more so when he saw buckbeak a few yards away tethered to a tree behind hagrids pumpkin patch buckbeak seemed to know something was happening he turned his sharp head from side to side and pawed the ground nervously its okay beaky said hagrid softly its okay he turned to harry ron and hermione go on he said get goin but they didnt move hagrid we cant well tell them what really happened they cant kill him go said hagrid fiercely its bad enough without you lot in trouble an all they had no choice as hermione threw the cloak over harry and ron they heard voices at the front of the cabin hagrid looked at the place where they had just vanished from sight go quick he said hoarsely don listen and he strode back into his cabin as someone knocked at the front door slowly in a kind of horrified trance harry ron and hermione set off silently around hagrids house as they reached the other side the front door closed with a sharp snap please lets hurry hermione whispered i cant stand it i cant bear it they started up the sloping lawn toward the castle the sun was sinking fast now the sky had turned to a clear purpletinged grey but to the west there was a rubyred glow ron stopped dead oh please ron hermione began its scabbers he wont stay put ron was bent over trying to keep scabbers in his pocket but the rat was going berserk squeaking madly twisting and flailing trying to sink his teeth into rons hand scabbers its me you idiot its ron ron hissed they heard a door open behind them and mens voices oh ron please lets move theyre going to do it hermione breathed okay scabbers stay put they walked forward harry like hermione was trying not to listen to the rumble of voices behind them ron stopped again i cant hold him scabbers shut up everyonell hear us the rat was squealing wildly but not loudly enough to cover up the sounds drifting from hagrids garden there was a jumble of indistinct male voices a silence and then without warning the unmistakable swish and thud of an axe hermione swayed on the spot they did it she whispered to harry i d dont believe it they did it chapter seventeen cat rat and dog harrys mind had gone blank with shock the three of them stood transfixed with horror under the invisibility cloak the very last rays of the setting sun were casting a bloody light over the long shadowed grounds then behind them they heard a wild howling hagrid harry muttered without thinking about what he was doing he made to turn back but both ron and hermione seized his arms we cant said ron who was paperwhite hell be in worse trouble if they know weve been to see him hermiones breathing was shallow and uneven how could they she choked how could they come on said ron whose teeth seemed to be chattering they set off back toward the castle walking slowly to keep themselves hidden under the cloak the light was fading fast now by the time they reached open ground darkness was settling like a spell around them scabbers keep still ron hissed clamping his hand over his chest the rat was wriggling madly ron came to a sudden halt trying to force scabbers deeper into his pocket whats the matter with you you stupid rat stay still ouch he bit me ron be quiet hermione whispered urgently fudgell be out here in a minute he wont stay put scabbers was plainly terrified he was writhing with all his might trying to break free of rons grip whats the matter with him but harry had just seen stinking toward them his body low to the ground wide yellow eyes glinting eerily in the darkness crookshanks whether he could see them or was following the sound of scabberss squeaks harry couldnt tell crookshanks hermione moaned no go away crookshanks go away but the cat was getting nearer scabbers no too late the rat had slipped between rons clutching fingers hit the ground and scampered away in one bound crookshanks sprang after him and before harry or hermione could stop him ron had thrown the invisibility cloak off himself and pelted away into the darkness ron hermione moaned she and harry looked at each other then followed at a sprint it was impossible to run full out under the cloak they pulled it off and it streamed behind them like a banner as they hurtled after ron they could hear his feet thundering along ahead and his shouts at crookshanks get away from him get away scabbers come here there was a loud thud gotcha get off you stinking cat harry and hermione almost fell over ron they skidded to a stop right in front of him he was sprawled on the ground but scabbers was back in his pocket he had both hands held tight over the quivering lump ron come on back under the cloak hermione panted dumbledore the minister theyll be coming back out in a minute but before they could cover themselves again before they could even catch their breath they heard the soft pounding of gigantic paws something was bounding toward them quiet as a shadow an enormous paleeyed jetblack dog harry reached for his wand but too late the dog had made an enormous leap and the front paws hit him on the chest he keeled over backward in a whirl of hair he felt its hot breath saw inch long teeth but the force of its leap had carried it too far it rolled off him dazed feeling as though his ribs were broken harry tried to stand up he could hear it growling as it skidded around for a new attack ron was on his feet as the dog sprang back toward them he pushed harry aside the dogs jaws fastened instead around rons outstretched arm harry lunged forward he seized a handful of the brutes hair but it was dragging ron away as easily as though he were a rag doll then out of nowhere something hit harry so hard across the face he was knocked off his feet again he heard hermione shriek with pain and fall too harry groped for his wand blinking blood out of his eyes lumoshe whispered the wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree they had chased scabbers into the shadow of the whomping willow and its branches were creaking as though in a high wind whipping backward and forward to stop them going nearer and there at the base of the trunk was the dog dragging ron backward into a large gap in the roots ron was fighting furiously but his head and torso were slipping out of sight ron harry shouted trying to follow but a heavy branch whipped lethally through the air and he was forced backward again all they could see now was one of rons legs which he had hooked around a root in an effort to stop the dog from pulling him farther underground but a horrible crack cut the air like a gunshot rons leg had broken and a moment later his foot vanished from sight harry weve got to go for help hermione gasped she was bleeding too the willow had cut her across the shoulder no that things big enough to eat him we havent got time harry were never going to get through without help another branch whipped down at them twigs clenched like knuckles if that dog can get in we can harry panted darting here and there trying to find a way through the vicious swishing branches but he couldnt get an inch nearer to the tree roots without being in range of the trees blows oh help help hermione whispered frantically dancing certainly on the spot please crookshanks darted forward he slithered between the battering branches like a snake and placed his front paws upon a knot on the trunk abruptly as though the tree had been turned to marble it stopped moving not a leaf twitched or shook crookshanks hermione whispered uncertainly she now grasped harrys arm painfully hard how did he know hes friends with that dog said harry grimly ive seen them together come on and keep your wand out they covered the distance to the trunk in seconds but before they had reached the gap in the roots crookshanks had slid into it with a flick of his bottlebrush tail harry went next he crawled forward headfirst and slid down an earthy slope to the bottom of a very low tunnel crookshanks was a little way along his eyes flashing in the light from harrys wand seconds later hermione slithered down beside him wheres ron she whispered in a terrified voice this way said harry setting off bentbacked after crookshanks where does this tunnel come out hermione asked breathlessly from behind him i dont know its marked on the marauders map but fred and george said no ones ever gotten into it it goes off the edge of the map but it looked like it was heading for hogsmeade they moved as fast as they could bent almost double ahead of them crookshankss tail bobbed in and out of view on and on went the passage it felt at least as long as the one to honeydukes all harry could think of was ron and what the enormous dog might be doing to him he was drawing breath in sharp painful gasps running at a crouch and then the tunnel began to rise moments later it twisted and crookshanks had gone instead harry could see a patch of dim light through a small opening he and hermione paused gasping for breath edging forward both raised their wands to see what lay beyond it was a room a very disordered dusty room paper was peeling from the walls there were stains all over the floor every piece of furniture was broken as though somebody had smashed it the windows were all boarded up harry glanced at hermione who looked very frightened but nodded harry pulled himself out of the hole staring around the room was deserted but a door to their right stood open leading to a shadowy hallway hermione suddenly grabbed harrys arm again her wide eyes were traveling around the boarded windows harry she whispered i think were in the shrieking shack harry looked around his eyes fell on a wooden chair near them large chunks had been torn out of it one of the legs had been ripped off entirely ghosts didnt do that he said slowly at that moment there was a creak overhead something had moved upstairs both of them looked up at the ceiling hermiones grip on harrys arm was so tight he was losing feeling inhis fingers he raised his eyebrows at her she nodded again and let go quietly as they could they crept out into the hall and up the crumbling staircase everything was covered in a thick layer of dust except the floor where a wide shiny stripe had been made by something being dragged upstairs they reached the dark landing nox they whispered together and the lights at the end of their wands went out only one door was open as they crept toward it they heard movement from behind it a low moan and then a deep loud purring they exchanged a last look a last nod wand held tightly before him harry kicked the door wide open on a magnificent fourposter bed with dusty hangings lay crookshanks purring loudly at the sight of them on the floor beside him clutching his leg which stuck out at a strange angle was ron harry and hermione dashed across to him ron are you okay wheres the dog not a dog ron moaned his teeth were gritted with pain harry its a trap what hes the dog hes an animagus ron was staring over harrys shoulder harry wheeled around with a snap the man in the shadows closed the door behind them a mass of filthy matted hair hung to his elbows if eyes hadnt been shining out of the deep dark sockets he might have been a corpse the waxy skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his face it looked like a skull his yellow teeth were bared in a grin it was sirius black expelliarmushe croaked pointing rons wand at them harrys and hermiones wands shot out of their hands high in the air and black caught them then he took a step closer his eyes were fixed on harry i thought youd come and help your friend he said hoarsely his voice sounded as though he had long since lost the habit of using it your father would have done the same for me brave of you not to run for a teacher im grateful it will make everything much easier the taunt about his father rang in harrys ears as though black had bellowed it a boiling hate erupted in harrys chest leaving no place for fear for the first time in his life he wanted his wand back in his hand not to defend himself but to attack to kill without knowing what he was doing he started forward but there was a sudden movement on either side of him and two pairs of hands grabbed him and held him back no harry hermione gasped in a petrified whisper ron however spoke to black if you want to kill harry youll have to kill us too he said fiercely though the effort of standing upright was draining him of still more color and he swayed slightly as he spoke something flickered in blacks shadowed eyes lie down he said quietly to ron you will damage that leg even more did you hear me ron said weakly though he was clinging painfully to harry to stay upright youll have to kill all three of us therell be only one murder here tonight said black and his grin widened whys that harry spat trying to wrench himself free of ron and hermione didnt care last time did you didnt mind slaughtering all those muggles to get at pettigrew whats the matter gone soft in azkaban harry hermione whimpered be quiet he killed my mum and dad harry roared and with a huge effort he broke free of hermiones and rons restraint and lunged forward he had forgotten about magic he had forgotten that he was short and skinny and thirteen where as black was a tall fullgrown man all harry knew was that he wanted to hurt black as badly as he could and that he didnt care how much he got hurt in return perhaps it was the shock of harry doing something so stupid but black didnt raise the wands in time one of harrys hands fastened over his wasted wrist forcing the wand tips away the knuckles of harrys other hand collided with the side of blacks head and they fell backward into the wall hermione was screaming ron was yelling there was a blinding flash as the wands in blacks hand sent a jet of sparks into the air that missed harrys face by inches harry felt the shrunken arm under his fingers twisting madly but he clung on his other hand punching every part of black it could find but blacks free hand had found harrys throat no he hissed ive waited too long the fingers tightened harry choked his glasses askew then he saw hermiones foot swing out of nowhere black let go of harry with a grunt of pain ron had thrown himself on blacks wand hand and harry heard a faint clatter he fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own wand rolling across the floor he threw himself toward it but argh crookshanks had joined the fray both sets of front claws had sunk themselves deep into harrys arm harry threw him off but crookshanks now darted toward harrys wand no you dont roared harry and he aimed a kick at crookshanks that made the cat leap aside spitting harry snatched up his wand and turned get out of the way he shouted at ron and hermione they didnt need telling twice hermione gasping for breath her lip bleeding scrambled aside snatching up her and rons wands ron crawled to the fourposter and collapsed onto it panting his white face now tinged with green both hands clutching his broken leg black was sprawled at the bottom of the wall his thin chest rose and fell rapidly as he watched harry walking slowly nearer his wand pointing straight at blacks heart going to kill me harry he whispered harry stopped right above him his wand still pointing at blacks chest looking down at him a livid bruise was rising around blacks left eye and his nose was bleeding you killed my parents said harry his voice shaking slightly but his wand hand quite steady black stared up at him out of those sunken eyes i dont deny it he said very quietly but if you knew the whole story the whole story harry repeated a furious pounding in his ears you sold them to voldemort thats all i need to know youve got to listen to me black said and there was a note of urgency in his voice now youll regret it if you dont you dont understand i understand a lot better than you think said harry and his voice shook more than ever you never heard her did you my mum trying to stop voldemort killing me and you did that you did it before either of them could say another word something ginger streaked past harry crookshanks leapt onto blacks chest and settled himself there right over blacks heart black blinked and looked down at the cat get off he murmured trying to push crookshanks off him but crookshanks sank his claws into blacks robes and wouldnt shift he turned his ugly squashed face to harry and looked up at him with those great yellow eyes to his right hermione gave a dry sob harry stared down at black and crookshanks his grip tightening on the wand so what if he had to kill the cat too it was in league with black if it was prepared to die trying to protect black that wasnt harrys business if black wanted to save it that only proved he cared more for crookshanks than for harrys parents harry raised the wand now was the moment to do it now was the moment to avenge his mother and father he was going to kill black he had to kill black this was his chance the seconds lengthened and still harry stood frozen there wand poised black staring up at him crookshanks on his chest rons ragged breathing came from near the bed hermione was quite silent and then came a new sound muffled footsteps were echoing up through the floor someone was moving downstairs were up here hermione screamed suddenly were up here sirius black quick black made a startled movement that almost dislodged crookshanks harry gripped his wand convulsively do it now said a voice in his head but the footsteps were thundering up the stairs and harry still hadnt done it the door of the room burst open in a shower of red sparks and harry wheeled around as professor lupin came hurtling into the room his face bloodless his wand raised and ready his eyes flickered over ron lying on the floor over hermione cowering next to the door to harry standing there with his wand covering black and then to black himself crumpled and bleeding at harrys feet expelliarmus lupin shouted harrys wand flew once more out of his hand so did the two hermione was holding lupin caught them all deftly then moved into the room staring at black who still had crookshanks lying protectively across his chest harry stood there feeling suddenly empty he hadnt done it his nerve had failed him black was going to be handed back to the dementors then lupin spoke in a very tense voice where is he sirius harry looked quickly at lupin he didnt understannd what lupin meant who was lupin talking about he turned to look at black again blacks face was quite expressionless for a few seconds he didnt move at all then very slowly he raised his empty hand and pointed straight at ron mystified harry glanced around at ron who looked bewildered but then lupin muttered staring at black so intently it seemed he was trying to read his mind why hasnt he shown himself before now unless lupins eyes suddenly widened as though he was seeing something beyond black something none of the rest could see unless he was the one unless you switched without telling me very slowly his sunken gaze never leaving lupins face black nodded professor harry interrupted loudly whats going on but he never finished the question because what he saw made his voice die in his throat lupin was lowering his wand gazing fixed at black the professor walked to blacks side seized his hand pulled him to his feet so that crookshanks fell to the floor and embraced black like a brother harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach dont believe it hermione screamed lupin let go of black and turned to her she had raised herself off the floor and was pointing at lupin wildeyed you you hermione you and him hermione calm down i didnt tell anyone hermione shrieked ive been covering up for you hermione listen to me please lupin shouted i can explain harry could feel himself shaking not with fear but with a fresh wave of fury i trusted you he shouted at lupin his voice wavering out of control and all the time youve been his friend youre wrong said lupin i havent been siriuss friend but i am now let me explain no hermione screamed harry dont trust him hes been helping black get into the castle he wants you dead too hes a werewolf there was a ringing silence everyones eyes were now on lupin who looked remarkably calm though rather pale not at all up to your usual standard hermione he said only one out of three im afraid i have not been helping sirius get into the castle and i certainly dont want harry dead an odd shiver passed over his face but i wont deny that i am a werewolf ron made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back with a whimper of pain lupin made toward him looking concerned but ron gasped get away ftom me werewolf lupin stopped dead then with an obvious effort he turned to hermione and said how long have you known ages hermione whispered since i did professor snapes essay hell be delighted said lupin coolly he assigned that essay hoping someone would realize what my symptoms meant did you check the lunar chart and realize that i was always ill at the full moon or did you realize that the boggart changed into the moon when it saw me both hermione said quietly lupin forced a laugh youre the cleverest witch of your age ive ever met hermione im not hermione whispered if id been a bit cleverer id have told everyone what you are but they already know said lupin at least the staff do dumbledore hired you when he knew you were a werewolf ron gasped is he mad some of the staff thought so said lupin he had to work very hard to convince certain teachers that im trustworthy and he was wrong harry yelled youve been helping him all the time he was pointing at black who suddenly crossed to the fourposter bed and sank onto it his face hidden in one shaking hand crookshanks leapt up beside him and stepped onto his lap purring ron edged away from both of them dragging his leg i have not been helping sirius said lupin if youll give me a chance ill explain look he separated harrys rons and hermiones wands and threw each back to its owner harry caught his stunned there said lupin sticking his own wand back into his belt youre armed were not now will you listen harry didnt know what to think was it a trick if you havent been helping him he said with a furious glance at black how did you know he was here the map said lupin the marauders map i was in my office examining it you know how to work it harry said suspiciously of course i know how to work it said lupin waving his hand impatiently i helped write it im moony that was my friends nickname for me at school you wrote the important thing is i was watching it carefully this evening because i had an idea that you ron and hermione might try and sneak out of the castle to visit hagrid before his hippogriff was executed and i was right wasnt i he had started to pace up and down looking at them little patches of dust rose at his feet you might have been wearing your fathers old cloak harry how dyou know about the cloak the number of times i saw james disappearing under it said lupin waving an impatient hand again the point is even if youre wearing an invisibility cloak you still show up on the marauders map i watched you cross the grounds and enter hagrids hut twenty minutes later you left hagrid and set off back toward the castle but you were now accompanied by somebody else what said harry no we werent i couldnt believe my eyes said lupin still pacing and ignoring harrys interruption i thought the map must be malfunctioning how could he be with you no one was with us said harry and then i saw another dot moving fast toward you labeled sirius black i saw him collide with you i watched as he pulled two of you into the whomping willow one of us ron said angrily no ron said lupin two of you he had stopped his pacing his eyes moving over ron do you think i could have a look at the rat he said evenly what said ron whats scabbers got to do with it everything said lupin could i see him please ron hesitated then put a hand inside his robes scabbers emerged thrashing desperately ron had to seize his long bald tail to stop him escaping crookshanks stood up on blacks leg and made a soft hissing noise lupin moved closer to ron he seemed to be holding his breath as he gazed intently at scabbers what ron said again holding scabbers close to him looking scared whats my rat got to do with anything thats not a rat croaked sirius black suddenly what dyou mean of course hes a rat no hes not said lupin quietly hes a wizard an animagus said black by the name of peter pettigrew chapter eighteen moony wormtail paddfoot and prongs it took a few seconds for the absurdity of this statement to sink in then ron voiced what harry was thinking youre both mental ridiculous said hermione faintly peter pettigrews dead said harry he killed him twelve years ago he pointed at black whose face twitched convulsively i meant to he growled his yellow teeth bared but little peter got the better of me not this time though and crookshanks was thrown to the floor as black lunged at scabbers ron yelled with pain as blacks weight fell on his broken leg sirius no lupin yelled launching himself forwards and dragging black away from ron again wait you cant do it just like that they need to understand weve got to explain we can explain afterwards snarled black trying to throw lupin off one hand was still clawing the air as it tried to reach scabbers who was squealing like a piglet scratching rons face and neck as he tried to escape theyve got a right to know everything lupin panted still trying to restrain black rons kept him as a pet there are parts of it even i dont understand and harry you owe harry the truth sirius black stopped struggling though his hollowed eyes were still fixed on scabbers who was clamped tightly under rons bitten scratched and bleeding hands all right then black said without taking his eyes off the rat tell them whatever you like but make it quick remus i want to commit the murder i was imprisoned for youre nutters both of you said ron shakily looking round at harry and hermione for support ive had enough of this im off he tried to heave himself up on his good leg but lupin raised his wand again pointing it at scabbers youre going to hear me out ron he said quietly just keep a tight hold on peter while you listen hes not peter hes scabbers ron yelled trying to force the rat back into his front pocket but scabbers was fighting to hard ron swayed and overbalanced and harry caught him am pushed him back down to the bed then ignoring black harry turned to lupin there were witnesses who saw pettigrew die he said a whole street full of them they didnt see what they thought they saw said black savagely still watching scabbers struggling in rons hands everyone thought sirius killed peter said lupin nodding i believed it myself until i saw the map tonight because the marauders map never lies peters alive rons holding him harry harry looked down at ron and as their eyes met they agreed silently black and lupin were both out of their minds their story made no sense whatsoever how could scabbers be peter pettigrew azkaban must have unhinged black after all but why was lupin playing along with him then hermione spoke in a trembling wouldbe calm sort of voice as though trying to will professor lupin to talk sensibly but professor lupin scabbers cant be pettigrew it just cant be true you know it cant why cant it be true lupin said calmly as though they were in class and hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experiment with grindylows because because people would know if peter pettigrew had been an animagus we did animagi in class with professor mcgonagall and i looked them up when i did my homework the ministry of magic keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can become animals theres a register showing what animal they become and their markings and things and i went and looked professor mcgonagall up on the register and there have been only seven animagi this century and pettigrews name wasnt on the list harry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the effort hermione put into her homework when lupin started to laugh right again hermione he said but the ministry never knew that there used to be three unregistered animagi running around hogwarts if youre going to tell them the story get a move on remus said black who was still watching scabberss every desperate move ive waited twelve years im not going to wait much longer all right but youll need to help me sirius said lupin i only know how it began lupin broke off there had been a loud creak behind him the bedroom door had opened of its own accord all five of them stared at it then lupin strode toward it and looked out into the landing no one there this place is haunted said ron its not said lupin still looking at the door in a puzzled way the shrieking shack was never haunted the screams and howls the villagers used to hear were made by me he pushed his graying hair out of his eyes thought for a moment then said thats where all of this starts with my becoming a werewolf none of this could have happened if i hadnt been bitten and if i hadnt been so foolhardy he looked sober and tired ron started to interrupt but hermione said shh she was watching lupin very intently i was a very small boy when i received the bite my parents tried everything but in those days there was no cure the potion that professor snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery it makes me safe you see as long as i take it in the week preceding the full moon i keep my mind when i transform im able to curl up in my office a harmless wolf and wait for the moon to wane again before the wolfsbane potion was discovered however i became a fully fledged monster once a month it seemed impossible that i would be able to come to hogwarts other parents werent likely to want their children exposed to me but then dumbledore became headmaster and he was sympathetic he said that as long as we took certain precautions there was no reason i shouldnt come to school lupin sighed and looked directly at harry i told you months ago that the whomping willow was planted the year i came to hogwarts the truth is that it was planted because i came to hogwarts this house lupin looked miserably around the room the tunnel that leads to it they were built for my use once a month i was smuggled out of the castle into this place to transform the tree was placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across me while i was dangerous harry couldnt see where this story was going but he was listening raptly all the same the only sound apart from lupins voice was scabberss frightened squeaking my transformations in those days were were terrible it is very painful to turn into a werewolf i was separated from humans to bite so i bit and scratched myself instead the villagers heard the noise and the screaming and thought they were hearing particularly violent spirits dumbledore encouraged the rumor even now when the house has been silent for years the villagers dont dare approach it but apart from my transformations i was happier than i had ever been in my life for the first time ever i had friends three great friends sirius black peter pettigrew and of course your father harry james potter now my three friends could hardly fail to notice that i disappeared once a month i made up all sorts of stories i told them my mother was ill and that i had to go home to see her i was terrified they would desert me the moment they found out what i was but of course they like you hermione worked out the truth and they didnt desert me at all instead they did something for me that would make my transformations not only bearable but the best times of my life they became animagi my dad too said harry astounded yes indeed said lupin it took them the best part of three years to work out how to do it your father and sirius here were the cleverest students in the school and lucky they were because the animagus transformation can go horribly wrong one reason the ministry keeps a close watch on those attempting to do it peter needed all the help he could get from james and sirius finally in our fifth year they managed it they could each turn into a different animal at will but how did that help you said hermione sounding puzzled they couldnt keep me company as humans so they kept me company as animals said lupin a werewolf is only a danger to people they sneaked out of the castle every month under jamess invisibility cloak they transformed peter as the smallest could slip beneath the willows attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it they would then slip down the tunnel and join me under their influence i became less dangerous my body was still wolfish but my mind seemed to become less so while i was with them hurry up remus snarled black who was still watching scabbers with a horrible sort of hunger on his face im getting there sirius im getting there well highly exciting possibilities were open to us now that we could all transform soon we were leaving the shrieking shack and roaming the school grounds and the village by night sirius and james transformed into such large animals they were able to keep a werewolf in check i doubt whether any hogwarts students ever found out more about the hogwarts grounds and hogsmeade than we did and thats how we came to write the marauders map and sign it with our nicknames sirius is padfoot peter is wormtail james was prongs what sort of animal harry began but hermione cut him off that was still really dangerous running around in the dark with a werewolf what if youd given the others the slip and bitten somebody a thought that still haunts me said lupin heavily and there were near misses many of them we laughed about them afterwards we were young thoughtless carried away with our own cleverness i sometimes felt guilty about betraying dumbledores trust of course he had admitted me to hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done so and he had no idea i was breaking the rules he had set down for my own and others safety he never knew i had led three fellow students into becoming animagi illegally but i always managed to forget my guilty feelings every time we sat down to plan our next months adventure and i havent changed lupins face had hardened and there was selfdisgust in his voice all this year i have been battling with myself wondering whether i should tell dumbledore that sirius was an animagus but i didnt do it why because i was too cowardly it would have meant admitting that id betrayed his trust while i was at school admitting that id led others along with me and dumbledores trust has meant everything to me he let me into hogwarts as a boy and he gave me a job when i have been shunned all my adult life unable to find paid work because of what i am and so i convinced myself that sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he learned from voldemort that being an animagus had nothing to do with it so in a way snapes been right about me all along snape said black harshly taking his eyes off scabbers for the first time in minutes and looking up at lupin whats snape got to do with it hes here sirius said lupin heavily hes teaching here as well he looked up at harry ron and hermione professor snape was at school with us he fought very hard against my appointment to the defense against the dark arts job he has been telling dumbledore a year that i am not to be trusted he has his reasons you see sirius here played a trick on him which nearly killed him a trick which involved me black made a derisive noise it served him right he sneered sneaking around trying to find out what we were up to hoping he could get us expelled severus was very interested in where i went every month lupin told harry ron and hermione we were in the same year you know and we er didnt like each other very much he especially disliked james jealous i think of jamess talent on the quidditch field anyway snape had seen me crossing the grounds with madam pomfrey one evening as she led me toward the whomping willow to transform sirius thought it would be er amusing to tell snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick and hed be able to get in after me well of course snape tried it if hed got as far as this house hed have met a fully grown werewolf but your father whod heard what sirius had done went after snape and pulled him back at great risk to his life snape glimpsed me though at the end of the tunnel he was forbidden by dumbledore to tell anybody but from that time on he knew what i was so thats why snape doesnt like you said harry slowly because he thought you were in on the joke thats right sneered a cold voice from the wall behind lupin severus snape was pulling off the invisibility cloak his wand pointing directly at lupin chapter nineteen the servant of lord voldemort hermione screamed black leapt to his feet harry felt as though hed received a huge electric shock i found this at the base of the whomping willow said snape throwing the cloak aside careful to keep this wand pointing directly at lupins chest very useful potter i thank you snape was slightly breathless but his face was full of suppressed triumph youre wondering perhaps how i knew you were here he said his eyes glittering ive just been to your office lupin you forgot to take your potion tonight so i took a gobletful along and very lucky i did lucky for me i mean lying on your desk was a certain map one glance at it told me all i needed to know i saw you running along this passageway and out of sight severus lupin began but snape overrode him ive told the headmaster again and again that youre helping your old friend black into the castle lupin and heres the proof not even i dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout severus youre making a mistake said lupin urgently you havent heard everything i can explain sirius is not here to kill harry two more for azkaban tonight said snape his eyes now gleaming fanatically i shall be interested to see how dumbledore takes this he was quite convinced you were harmless you know lupin a tame werewolf you fool said lupin softly is a schoolboy grudge worth putting an innocent man back inside azkaban bang thin snakelike cords burst from the end of snapes wand and twisted themselves around lupins mouth wrists and ankles he overbalanced and fell to the floor unable to move with a roar of rage black started toward snape but snape pointed his wand straight between blacks eyes give me a reason he whispered give me a reason to do it and i swear i will black stopped dead it would have been impossible to say which face showed more hatred harry stood there paralyzed not knowing what to do or whom to believe he glanced around at ron and hermione ron looked just as confused as he did still fighting to keep hold on the struggling scabbers hermione however took an uncertain step toward snape and said in a very breathless voice professor snape it it wouldnt hurt to hear what theyve got to say w would it miss granger you are already facing suspension from this school snape spat you potter and weasley are outofbounds in the company of a convicted murderer and a werewolf for once in your life hold your tongue but if if there was a mistake keep quiet you stupid girl snape shouted looking suddenly quite deranged dont talk about what you dont understand a few sparks shot out of the end of his wand which was still pointed at blacks face hermione fell silent vengeance is very sweet snape breathed at black how i hoped i would be the one to catch you the jokes on you again severus black snarled as long as this boy brings his rat up to the castle he jerked his head at ron ill come quietly up to the castle said snape silkily i dont think we need to go that far all i have to do is call the dementors once we get out of the willow theyll be very pleased to see you black pleased enough to give you a little kiss i daresay i what little color there was in blacks face left it you youve got to hear me out he croaked the rat look at the rat but there was a mad glint in snapes eyes that harry had never seen before he seemed beyond reason come on all of you he said he clicked his fingers and the ends of the cords that bound lupin flew to his hands ill drag the werewolf perhaps the dementors will have a kiss for him too before he knew what he was doing harry had crossed the room in three strides and blocked the door get out of the way potter youre in enough trouble already snarled snape if i hadnt been here to save your skin professor lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year harry said ive been alone with him loads of times having defense lessons against the dementors if he was helping black why didnt he just finish me off then dont ask me to fathom the way a werewolfs mind works hissed snape get out of the way potter youre pathetic harry yelled just because they made a fool of you at school you wont even listen silence i will not be spoken to like that snape shrieked looking madder than ever like father like son potter i have just saved your neck you should be thanking me on bended knee you would have been well served if hed killed you youd have died like your father too arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in black now get out of the way or i will make you get out of the way potter harry made up his mind in a split second before snape could take even one step toward him he had raised his wand expelliarmus he yelled except that his wasnt the only voice that shouted there was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall then slid down it to the floor a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair he had been knocked out harry looked around both ron and hermione had tried to disarm snape at exactly the same moment snapes wand soared in a high arc and landed on the bed next to crookshanks you shouldnt have done that said black looking at harry you should have left him to me harry avoided blacks eyes he wasnt sure even now that hed done the right thing we attacked a teacher we attacked a teacher hermione whimpered staring at the lifeless snape with frightened eyes oh were going to be in so much trouble lupin was struggling against his bonds black bent down quickly and untied him lupin straightened up rubbing his arms where the ropes had cut into them thank you harry he said im still not saying i believe you he told lupin then its time we offered you some proof said lupin you boy give me peter please now ron clutched scabbers closer to his chest come off it he said weakly are you trying to say he broke out of azkaban just to get his hands on scabbers i mean he looked up at harry and hermione for support okay say pettigrew could turn into a rat there are millions of rats hows he supposed to know which one hes after if he was locked up in azkaban you know sirius thats a fair question said lupin turning to black and frowning slightly how did you find out where he was black put one of his clawlike hands inside his robes and took out a crumpled piece of paper which he smoothed flat and held out to show the others it was the photograph of ron and his family that had appeared in the daily prophet the previous summer and there on rons shoulder was scabbers how did you get this lupin asked black thunderstruck fudge said black when he came to inspect azkaban last year he gave me his paper and there was peter on the front page on this boys shoulder i knew him at once how many times had i seen him transform and the caption said the boy would be going back to hogwarts to where harry was my god said lupin softly staring from scabbers to the picture in the paper and back again his front paw what about it said ron defiantly hes got a toe missing said black of course lupin breathed so simple so brilliant he cut it off himself just before he transformed said black when i cornered him he yelled for the whole street to hear that id betrayed lily and james then before i could curse him he blew apart the street with the wand behind his back killed everyone within twenty feet of himself and sped down into the sewer with the other rats didnt you ever hear ron said lupin the biggest bit of peter they found was his finger look scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or something hes been in my family for ages right twelve years in fact said lupin didnt you ever wonder why he was living so long we weve been taking good care of him said ron not looking too good at the moment though is he said lupin id guess hes been losing weight ever since he heard sirius was on the loose again hes been scared of that mad cat said ron nodding toward crookshanks who was still purring on the bed but that wasnt right harry thought suddenly scabbers had been looking ill before he met crookshanks ever since rons return from egypt since the time when black had escaped this cat isnt mad said black hoarsely he reached out a bony hand and stroked crookshankss fluffy head hes the most intelligent of his kind ive ever met he recognized peter for what he was right away and when he met me he knew i was no dog it was a while before he trusted me finally i managed to communicate to him what i was after and hes been helping me what do you mean breathed hermione he tried to bring peter to me but couldnt so he stole the passwords into gryffindor tower for me as i understand it he took them from a boys bedside table harrys brain seemed to be sagging under the weight of what he was hearing it was absurd and yet but peter got wind of what was going on and ran for it croaked black this cat crookshanks did you call him told me peter had left blood on the sheets i supposed he bit himself well faking his own death had worked once these words jolted harry to his senses and why did he fake his death he said furiously because he knew you were about to kill him like you killed my parents no said lupin harry and now youve come to finish him off yes i have said black with an evil look at scabbers then i shouldve let snape take you harry shouted harry said lupin hurriedly dont you see all this time weve thought sirius betrayed your parents and peter tracked him down but it was the other way around dont you see peter betrayed your mother and father sirius tracked peter down thats not true harry yelled he was their secretkeeper he said so before you turned up he said he killed them he was pointing at black who shook his head slowly the sunken eyes were suddenly over bright harry i as good has killed them he croaked i persuaded lily and james to change to peter at the last moment persuaded them to use him as secretkeeper instead of me im to blame i know it the night they died id arranged to check on peter make sure he was still safe but when i arrived at his hiding place hed gone yet there was no sign of a struggle it didnt feel right i was scared i set out for your parents house straight away and when i saw their house destroyed and their bodies i realized what peter mustve done what id done his voice broke he turned away enough of this said lupin and there was a steely note in his voice harry had never heard before theres one certain way to prove what really happened ron give me that rat what are you going to do with him if i give him to you ron asked lupin tensely force him to show himself said lupin if he really is a rat it wont hurt him ron hesitated then at long last he held out scabbers and lupin took him scabbers began to squeak without stopping twisting and turning his tiny black eyes bulging in his head ready sirius said lupin black had already retrieved snapes wand from the bed he approached lupin and the struggling rat and his wet eyes suddenly seemed to be burning in his face together he said quietly i think so said lupin holding scabbers tightly in one hand and his wand in the other on the count of three one two three a flash of bluewhite light erupted from both wands for a moment scabbers was frozen in midair his small gray form twisting madly ron yelled the rat fell and hit the floor there was another blinding flash of light and then it was like watching a speededup film of a growing tree a head was shooting upward from the ground limbs were sprouting a moment later a man was standing where scabbers had been cringing and wringing his hands crookshanks was spitting and snarling on the bed the hair on his back was standing up he was a very short man hardly taller than harry and hermione his thin colorless hair was unkempt and there was a large bald patch on top he had the shrunken appearance of a plump man who has lost a lot of weight in a short time his skin looked grubby almost like scabberss fur and something of the rat lingered around his pointed nose and his very small watery eyes he looked around at them all his breathing fast and shallow harry saw his eyes dart to the door and back again well hello peter said lupin pleasantly as though rats frequently erupted into old school friends around him long time no see s sirius r remus even pettigrews voice was squeaky again his eyes darted toward the door my friends my old friends blacks wand arm rose but lupin seized him around the wrist gave him a warning look then turned again to pettigrew his voice light and casual weve been having a little chat peter about what happened the night lily and james died you might have missed the finer points while you were squeaking around down there on the bed remus gasped pettigrew and harry could see beads of sweat breaking out over his pasty face you dont believe him do you he tried to kill me remus so weve heard said lupin more coldly id like to clear up one or two little matters with you peter if youll be so hes come to try and kill me again pettigrew squeaked suddenly pointing at black and harry saw that he used his middle finger because his index was missing he killed lily and james and now hes going to kill me too youve got to help me remus blacks face looked more skulllike than ever as he stared at pettigrew with his fathomless eyes no ones going to try and kill you until weve sorted a few things out said lupin sorted things out squealed pettigrew looking wildly about him once more eyes taking in the boarded windows and again the only door i knew hed come after me i knew hed be back for me ive been waiting for this for twelve years you knew sirius was going to break out of azkaban said lupin his brow furrowed when nobody has ever done it before hes got dark powers the rest of us can only dream of pettigrew shouted shrilly how else did he get out of there i suppose hewhomustnotbenamed taught him a few tricks black started to laugh a horrible mirthless laugh that filled the whole room voldemort teach me tricks he said pettigrew flinched as though black had brandished a whip at him what scared to hear your old masters name said black i dont blame you peter his lot arent very happy with you are they dont know what you mean sirius muttered pettigrew his breathing faster than ever his whole face was shining with sweat now you havent been hiding from me for twelve years said black youve been hiding from voldemorts old supporters i heard things in azkaban peter they all think youre dead or youd have to answer to them ive heard them screaming all sorts of things in their sleep sounds like they think the doublecrosser doublecrossed them voldemort went to the potters on your information and voldemort met his downfall there and not all voldemorts supporters ended up in azkaban did they there are still plenty out there biding their time pretending theyve seen the error of their ways if they ever got wind that you were still alive peter dont know what youre talking about said pettigrew again more shrilly than ever he wiped his face on his sleeve and looked up at lupin you dont believe this this madness remus i must admit peter i have difficulty in understanding why an innocent man would want to spend twelve years as a rat said lupin evenly innocent but scared squealed pettigrew if voldemorts supporters were after me it was because i put one of their best men in azkaban the spy sirius black blacks face contorted how dare you he growled sounding suddenly like the bearsized dog he had been i a spy for voldemort when did i ever sneak around people who were stronger and more powerful than myself but you peter ill never understand why i didnt see you were the spy from the start you always liked big friends whod look after you didnt you it used to be us me and remus and james pettigrew wiped his face again he was almost panting for breath me a spy must be out of your mind never dont know how you can say such a lily and james only made you secretkeeper because i suggested it black hissed so venomously that pettigrew took a step backward i thought it was the perfect plan a bluff voldemort would be sure to come after me would never dream theyd use a weak talentless thing like you it must have been the finest moment of your miserable life telling voldemort you could hand him the potters pettigrew was muttering distractedly harry caught words like farfetched and lunacy but he couldnt help paying more attention to the ashen color of pettigrews face and the way his eyes continued to dart toward the windows and door professor lupin said hermione timidly can can i say something certainly hermione said lupin courteously well scabbers i mean this this man hes been sleeping in harrys dormitory for three years if hes working for youknowwho how come he never tried to hurt harry before now there said pettigrew shrilly pointing at ron with his maimed hand thank you you see remus i have never hurt a hair of harrys head why should i ill tell you why said black because you never did anything for anyone unless you could see what was in it for you voldemorts been in hiding for fifteen years they say hes half dead you werent about to commit murder right under albus dumbledores nose for a wreck of a wizard whod lost all of his power were you youd want to be quite sure he was the biggest bully in the playground before you went back to him wouldnt you why else did you find a wizard family to take you in keeping an ear out for news werent you peter just in case your old protector regained strength and it was safe to rejoin him pettigrew opened his mouth and closed it several times he seemed to have lost the ability to talk er mr black sirius said hermione black jumped at being addressed like this and stared at hermione as though he had never seen anything quite like her if you dont mind me asking how how did you get out of azkaban if you didnt use dark magic thank you gasped pettigrew nodding frantically at her exactly precisely what i but lupin silenced him with a look black was frowning slightly at hermione but not as though he were annoyed with her he seemed to be pondering his answer i dont know how i did it he said slowly i think the only reason i never lost my mind is that i knew i was innocent that wasnt a happy thought so the dementors couldnt suck it out of me but it kept me sane and knowing who i am helped me keep my powers so when it all became too much i could transform in my cell become a dog dementors cant see you know he swallowed they feel their way toward people by feeding off their emotions they could tell that my feelings were less less human less complex when i was a dog but they thought of course that i was losing my mind like everyone else in there so it didnt trouble them but i was weak very weak and i had no hope of driving them away from me without a wand but then i saw peter in that picture i realized he was at hogwarts with harry perfectly positioned to act if one hint reached his ears that the dark side was gathering strength again pettigrew was shaking his head mouthing noiselessly but staring all the while at black as though hypnotized ready to strike at the moment he could be sure of allies and to deliver the last potter to them if he gave them harry whod dare say hed betrayed lord voldemort hed be welcomed back with honors so you see i had to do something i was the only one who knew peter was still alive harry remembered what mr weasley had told mrs wealsey the guards say hes been talking in his sleep always the same words hes at hogwarts it was as if someone had lit a fire in my head and the dementors couldnt destroy it it wasnt a happy feeling it was an obsession but it gave me strength it cleared my mind so one night when they opened my door to bring food i slipped past them as a dog its so much harder for them to sense animal emotions that they were confused i was thin very thin thin enough to slip through the bars i swam as a dog back to the mainland i journeyed north and slipped into the hogwarts grounds as a dog ive been living in the forest ever since except when i came to watch the quidditch of course you fly as well as your father did harry he looked at harry who did not look away believe me croaked black believe me harry i never betrayed james and lily i would have died before i betrayed them and at long last harry believed him throat too tight to speak he nodded no pettigrew had fallen to his knees as though harrys nod had been his own death sentence he shuffled forward on his knees groveling his hands clasped in front of him as though praying sirius its me its peter your friend you wouldnt black kicked out and pettigrew recoiled theres enough filth on my robes without you touching them said black remus pettigrew squeaked turning to lupin instead writhing imploringly in front of him you dont believe this wouldnt you sirius have told you theyd changed the plan not if he thought i was the spy peter said lupin i assume thats why you didnt tell me sirius he said casually over pettigrews head forgive me remus said black not at all padfoot old friend said lupin who was now rolling up his sleeves and will you in turn forgive me for believing you were the spy of course said black and the ghost of a grin flitted across his gaunt face he too began rolling up his sleeves shall we kill him together yes i think so said lupin grimly you wouldnt you wont gasped pettigrew and he scrambled around to ron ron havent i been a good friend a good pet you wont let them kill me ron will you youre on my side arent you but ron was staring at pettigrew with the utmost revulsion i let you sleep in my bed he said kind boy kind master pettigrew crawled toward ron you wont let them do it i was your rat i was a good pet if you made a better rat than a human its not much to boast about peter said black harshly ron going still paler with pain wrenched his broken leg out of pettigrews reach pettigrew turned on his knees staggered forward and seized the hem of hermiones robes sweet girl clever girl you you wont let them help me hermione pulled her robes out of pettigrews clutching hands and backed away against the wall looking horrified pettigrew knelt trembling uncontrollably andturned his head slowly toward harry harry harry you look just like your father just like him how dare you speak to harry roared black how dare you face him how dare you talk about james in front of him harry whispered pettigrew shuffling toward him hands outstretched harry james wouldnt have wanted me killed james would have understood harry he would have shown me mercy both black and lupin strode forward seized pettigrews shoulders and threw him backward onto the floor he sat there twitching with terror staring up at them you sold lily and james to voldemort said black who was shaking too do you deny it pettigrew burst into tears it was horrible to watch like an oversized balding baby cowering on the floor sirius sirius what could i have done the dark lord you have no idea he has weapons you cant imagine i was scared sirius i was never brave like you and remus and james i never meant it to happen hewhomustnotbenamed forced me dont lie bellowed black youd been passing information to him for a year before lily and james died you were his spy he he was taking over everywhere gasped pettigrew wh what was there to be gained by refusing him what was there to be gained by fighting the most evil wizard who has ever existed said black with a terrible fury in his face only innocent lives peter you dont understand whined pettigrew he would have killed me sirius then you should have died roared black died rather than betray your friends as we would have done for you black and lupin stood shoulder to shoulder wands raised you should have realized said lupin quietly if voldemort didnt kill you we would goodbye peter hermione covered her face with her hands and turned to the wall no harry yelled he ran forward placing himself in front pettigrew facing the wands you cant kill him he said breathlessly you cant black and lupin both looked staggered harry this piece of vermin is the reason you have no parents black snarled this cringing bit of filth would have seen you die too without turning a hair you heard him his own stinking skin meant more to him than your whole family i know harry panted well take him up to the castle well hand him over to the dementors he can go to azkaban but dont kill him harry gasped pettigrew and he flung his arms around harrys knees you thank you its more than i deserve thank you get off me harry spat throwing pettigrews hands off him in disgust im not doing this for you im doing it because i dont reckon my dad wouldve wanted them to become killers just for you no one moved or made a sound except pettigrew whose breath was coming in wheezes as he clutched his chest black and lupin were looking at each other then with one movement they lowered their wands youre the only person who has the right to decide harry said black but think think what he did he can go to azkaban harry repeated if anyone deserves that place he does pettigrew was still wheezing behind him very well said lupin stand aside harry harry hesitated im going to tie him up said lupin thats all i swear harry stepped out of the way thin cords shot from lupins wand this time and next moment pettigrew was wriggling on the floor bound and gagged but if you transform peter growled black his own wand pointing at pettigrew too we will kill you you agree harry harry looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor and nodded so that pettigrew could see him right said lupin suddenly businesslike ron i cant mend bones nearly as well as madam pomfrey so i think its best if we just strap your leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing he hurried over to ron bent down tapped rons leg with his wand and muttered ferula bandages spun up rons leg strapping it tightly to a splint lupin helped him to his feet ron put his weight gingerly on the leg and didnt wince thats better he said thanks what about professor snape said hermione in a small voice looking down at snapes prone figure theres nothing seriously wrong with him said lupin bending over snape and checking his pulse you were just a little overenthusiastic still out cold er perhaps it will be best if we dont revive him until were safety back in the castle we can take him like this he muttered mobilicorpus as though invisible strings were tied to snapes wrists neck and knees he was pulled into a standing position head still lolling unpleasantly like a grotesque puppet he hung a few inches above the ground his limp feet dangling lupin picked up the invisibility cloak and tucked it safely into his pocket and two of us should be chained to this said black nudging pettigrew with his toe just to make sure ill do it said lupin and me said ron savagely limping forward black conjured heavy manacles from thin air soon pettigrew was upright again left arm chained to lupins right right arm to rons left rons face was set he seemed to have taken scabberss true identity as a personal insult crookshanks leapt lightly off the bed and led the way out of the room his bottlebrush tail held jauntily high chapter twenty the dementors kiss harry had never been part of a stranger group crookshanks led the way down the stairs lupin pettigrew and ron went next looking like entrants in a sixlegged race next came professor snape drifting creepily along his toes hitting each stair as they descended held up by his own wand which was being pointed at him by sirius harry and hermione brought up the rear getting back into the tunnel was difficult lupin pettigrew and ron had to turn sideways to manage it lupin still had pettigrew covered with his wand harry could see them edging awkwardly along the tunnel in single file crookshanks was still in the lead harry went right after black who was still making snape drift along ahead of them he kept bumping his lolling head on the low ceiling harry had the impression black was making no effort to prevent this you know what this means black said abruptly to harry as they made their slow progress along the tunnel turning pettigrew in you re free said harry yes said black but im also i dont know if anyone ever told you im your godfather yeah i knew that said harry well your parents appointed me your guardian said black stiffly if anything happened to them harry waited did black mean what he thought he meant ill understand of course if you want to stay with your aunt and uncle said black but well think about it once my names cleared if you wanted a a different home some sort of explosion took place in the pit of harrys stomach what live with you he said accidentally cracking his head on a bit of rock protruding from the ceiling leave the dursleys of course i thought you wouldnt want to said black quickly i understand i just thought id are you insane said harry his voice easily as croaky as blacks of course i want to leave the dursleys have you got a house when can i move in black turned right around to look at him snapes head was scraping the ceiling but black didnt seem to care you want to he said you mean it yeah i mean it said harry blacks gaunt face broke into the first true smile harry had seen upon it the difference it made was startling as though a person ten years younger were shining through the starved mask for a moment he was recognizable as the man who had laughed at harrys parents wedding they did not speak again until they had reached the end of the tunnel crookshanks darted up first he had evidently pressed his paw to the knot on the trunk because lupin pettigrew and ron clambered upward without any sound of savaging branches black saw snape up through the hole then stood back for harry and hermione to pass at last all of them were out the grounds were very dark now the only light came from the distant windows of the castle without a word they set off pettigrew was still wheezing and occasionally whimpering harrys mind was buzzing he was going to leave the dursleys he was going to live with sirius black his parents best friend he felt dazed what would happen when he told the dursleys he was going to live with the convict theyd seen on television one wrong move peter said lupin threateningly ahead his wand was still pointed sideways at pettigrews chest silently they tramped through the grounds the castle lights growing slowly larger snape was still drifting weirdly ahead of black his chin bumping on his chest and then a cloud shifted there were suddenly dim shadows on the ground their party was bathed in moonlight snape collided with lupin pettigrew and ron who had stopped abruptly black froze he flung out one arm to make harry and hermione stop harry could see lupins silhouette he had gone rigid then his limbs began to shake oh my hermione gasped he didnt take his potion tonight hes not safe run black whispered run now but harry couldnt run ron was chained to pettigrew and lupin he leapt forward but black caught him around the chest and threw him back leave it to me run there was a terrible snarling noise lupins head was lengthening so was his body his shoulders were hunching hair was sprouting visibly on his face and hands which were curling into clawed paws crookshankss hair was on end again he was backing away as the werewolf reared snapping its long jaws sirius disappeared from harrys side he had transformed the enormous bearlike dog bounded forward as the werewolf wrenched itself free of the manacle binding it the dog seized it about the neck and pulled it backward away from ron and pettigrew they were locked jaw to jaw claws ripping at each other harry stood transfixed by the sight too intent upon the battle to notice anything else it was hermiones scream that alerted him pettigrew had dived for lupins dropped wand ron unsteady on his bandaged leg fell there was a bang a burst of light and ron lay motionless on the ground another bang crookshanks flew into the air and back to the earth in a heap expelliarmus harry yelled pointing his own wand at pettigrew lupins wand flew high into the air and out of sight stay where you are harry shouted running forward too late pettigrew had transformed harry saw his bald tail whip through the manacle on rons outstretched arm and heard a scurrying through the grass there was a howl and a rumbling growl harry turned to see the werewolf taking flight it was galloping into the forest sirius hes gone pettigrew transformed harry yelled black was bleeding there were gashes across his muzzle and back but at harrys words he scrambled up again and in an instant the sound of his paws faded to silence as he pounded away across the grounds harry and hermione dashed over to ron what did he do to him hermione whispered rons eyes were only halfclosed his mouth hung open he was definitely alive they could hear him breathing but he didnt seem to recognize them i dont know harry looked desperately around black and lupin both gone they had no one but snape for company still hanging unconscious in midair wed better get them up to the castle and tell someone said harry pushing his hair out of his eyes trying to think straight come but then from beyond the range of their vision they heard a yelping a whining a dog in pain sirius harry muttered staring into the darkness he had a moments indecision but there was nothing they could do for ron at the moment and by the sound of it black was in trouble harry set off at a run hermione right behind him the yelping seemed to be coming from the ground near the edge of the lake they pelted toward it and harry running flat out felt the cold without realizing what it must mean the yelping stopped abruptly as they reached the lakeshore they saw why sirius had turned back into a man he was crouched on all fours his hands over his head nooo he moaned nooo please and then harry saw them dementors at least a hundred of them gliding in a black mass around the lake toward them he spun around the familiar icy cold penetrating his insides fog starting to obscure his vision more were appearing out of the darkness on every side they were encircling them hermione think of something happy harry yelled raising his wand blinking furiously to try and clear his vision shaking his head to rid it of the faint screaming that had started inside it im going to live with my godfather im leaving the dursleys he forced himself to think of black and only black and began to chant expecto patronum expecto patronum black gave a shudder rolled over and lay motionless on the ground pale as death hell be all right im going to go and live with him expecto patronum hermione help me expecto patronum expecto hermione whispered expecto expecto but she couldnt do it the dementors were closing in barely ten feet from them they formed a solid wall around harry and hermione and were getting closer expecto patronum harry yelled trying to blot the screaming from his ears expecto patronum a thin wisp of silver escaped his wand and hovered like mist before him at the same moment harry felt hermione collapse next to him he was alone completely alone expecto expecto patronum harry felt his knees hit the cold grass fog was clouding his eyes with a huge effort he fought to remember sirius was innocent innocent well be okay i m going to live with him expecto patronum he gasped by the feeble light of his formless patronus he saw a dementor halt very close to him it couldnt walk through the cloud of silver mist harry had conjured a dead slimy hand slid out from under the cloak it made a gesture as though to sweep the patronus aside no no harry gasped hes innocent expecto expecto patronum he could feel them watching him hear their rattling breath like an evil wind around him the nearest dementor seemed to be considering him then it raised both its rotting hands and lowered its hood where there should have been eyes there was only thin gray scabbed skin stretched blankly over empty sockets but there was a mouth a gaping shapeless hole sucking the air with the sound of a death rattle a paralyzing terror filled harry so that he couldnt move or speak his patronus flickered and died white fog was blinding him he had to fight expecto patronum he couldnt see and in the distance he heard the familiar screaming expecto patronum he groped in the mist for sirius and found his arm they werent going to take him but a pair of strong clammy hands suddenly attached themselves around harrys neck they were forcing his face upward he could feel its breath it was going to get rid of him first he could feel its putrid breath his mother was screaming in his ears she was going to be the last thing he ever heard and then through the fog that was drowning him he thought he saw a silvery light growing brighter and brighter he felt himself fall forward onto the grass facedown too weak to move sick and shaking harry opened his eyes the dementor must have released him the blinding light was illuminating the grass around him the screaming had stopped the cold was ebbing away something was driving the dementors back it was circling around him and black and hermione they were leaving the air was warm again with every ounce of strength he could muster harry raised his head a few inches and saw an animal amid the light galloping away across the lake eyes blurred with sweat harry tried to make out what it was it was as bright as a unicorn fighting to stay conscious harry watched it canter to a halt as it reached the opposite shore for a moment harry saw by its brightness somebody welcoming it back raising his hand to pat it someone who looked strangely familiar but it couldnt be harry didnt understand he couldnt think anymore he felt the last of his strength leave him and his head hit the ground as he fainted chapter twentyone hermiones secret shocking business shocking miracle none of them died never heard the like by thunder it was lucky you were there snape thank you minister order of merlin second class id say first class if i can wangle it thank you very much indeed minister nasty cut youve got there blacks work i suppose as a matter of fact it was potter weasley and granger minister no black had bewitched them i saw it immediately a confundus charm to judge by their behavior they seemed to think there was a possibility he was innocent they werent responsible for their actions on the other hand their interference might have permitted black to escape they obviously thought they were going to catch black singlehanded theyve got away with a great deal before now im afraid its given them a rather high opinion of themselves and of course potter has always been allowed an extraordinary amount of license by the headmaster ah well snape harry potter you know weve all got a bit of a blind spot where hes concerned and yet is it good for him to be given so much special treatment personally i try and treat him like any other student and any other student would be suspended at the very least for leading his friends into such danger consider minister against all school rules after all the precautions put in place for his protection outofbounds at night consorting with a werewolf and a murderer and i have reason to believe he has been visiting hogsmeade illegally too well well we shall see snape we shall see the boy has undoubtedly been foolish harry lay listening with his eyes tight shut he felt very groggy the words he was hearing seemed to be traveling very slowly from his ears to his brain so that it was difficult to understand his limbs felt like lead his eyelids too heavy to lift he wanted to lie here on this comfortable bed forever what amazes me most is the behavior of the dementors youve really no idea what made them retreat snape no minister by the time i had come around they were heading back to their positions at the entrances extraordinary and yet black and harry and the girl all unconscious by the time i reached them i bound and gagged black naturally conjured stretchers and brought them all straight back to the castle there was a pause harrys brain seemed to be moving a little faster and as it did a gnawing sensation grew in the pit of his stomach he opened his eyes everything was slightly blurred somebody had removed his glasses he was lying in the dark hospital wing at the very end of the ward he could make out madam pomfrey with her back to him bending over a bed harry squinted rons red hair was visible beneath madam pomfreys arm harry moved his head over on the pillow in the bed to his right lay hermione moonlight was falling across her bed her eyes were open too she looked petrified and when she saw that harry was awake pressed a finger to her lips then pointed to the hospital wing door it was ajar and the voices of cornelius fudge and snape were coming through it from the corridor outside madam pomfrey now came walking briskly up the dark ward to harrys bed he turned to look at her she was carrying the largest block of chocolate he had ever seen in his life it looked like a small boulder ah youre awake she said briskly she placed the chocolate on harrys bedside table and began breaking it apart with a small hammer hows ron said harry and hermione together hell live said madam pomfrey grimly as for you two youll be staying here until im satisfied youre potter what do you think youre doing harry was sitting up putting his glasses back on and picking up his wand i need to see the headmaster he said potter said madam pomfrey soothingly its all right theyve got black hes locked away upstairs the dementors will be performing the kiss any moment now what harry jumped up out of bed hermione had done the same but his shout had been heard in the corridor outside next second cornelius fudge and snape had entered the ward harry harry whats this said fudge looking agitated you should be in bed has he had any chocolate he asked madam pomfrey anxiously minister listen harry said sirius blacks innocent peter pettigrew faked his own death we saw him tonight you cant let the dementors do that thing to sirius hes but fudge was shaking his head with a small smile on his face harry harry youre very confused youve been through a dreadful ordeal lie back down now weve got everything under control you havent harry yelled youve got the wrong man minister listen please hermione said she had hurried to harrys side and was gazing imploringly into fudges face i saw him too it was rons rat hes an animagus pettigrew i mean and you see minister said snape confunded both of them blacks done a very good job on them were not confunded harry roared minister professor said madam pomfrey angrily i must insist that you leave potter is my patient and he should not be distressed im not distressed im trying to tell them what happened harry said furiously if theyd just listen but madam pomfrey suddenly stuffed a large chunk of chocolate into harrys mouth he choked and she seized the opportunity to force him back onto the bed now please minister these children need care please leave the door opened again it was dumbledore harry swallowed his mouthful of chocolate with great difficulty and got up again professor dumbledore sirius black for heavens sake said madam pomfrey hysterically is this a hospital wing or not headmaster i must insist my apologies poppy but i need a word with mr potter and miss granger said dumbledore calmly i have just been talking to sirius black i suppose hes told you the same fairy tale hes planted in potters mind spat snape something about a rat and pettigrew being alive that indeed is blacks story said dumbledore surveying snape closely through his halfmoon spectacles and does my evidence count for nothing snarled snape peter pettigrew was not in the shrieking shack nor did i see any sign of him on the grounds that was because you were knocked out professor said hermione earnestly you didnt arrive in time to hear miss granger hold your tongue now snape said fudge startled the young lady is disturbed in her mind we must make allowances i would like to speak to harry and hermione alone said dumbledore abruptly cornelius severus poppy please leave us headmaster sputtered madam pomfrey they need treatment they need rest this cannot wait said dumbledore i must insist madam pomfrey pursed her lips and strode away into her office at the end of the ward slamming the door behind her fudge consulted the large gold pocket watch dangling from his waistcoat the dementors should have arrived by now he said ill go and meet them dumbledore ill see you upstairs he crossed to the door and held it open for snape but snape hadnt moved you surely dont believe a word of blacks story snape whispered his eyes fixed on dumbledores face i wish to speak to harry and hermione alone dumbledore repeated snape took a step toward dumbledore sirius black showed he was capable of murder at the age of sixteen he breathed you havent forgotten that headmaster you havent forgotten that he once tried to kill me my memory is as good as it ever was severus said dumbledore quietly snape turned on his heel and marched through the door fudge was still holding it closed behind them and dumbledore turned to harry and hermione they both burst into speech at the same time professor blacks telling the truth we saw pettigrew he escaped when professor lupin turned into a werewolf hes a rat pettigrews front paw i mean finger he cut it off pettigrew attacked ron it wasnt sirius but dumbledore held up his hand to stem the flood of explanations it is your turn to listen and i beg you will not interrupt me because there is very little time he said quietly there is not a shred of proof to support blacks story except your word and the word of two thirteenyearold wizards will not convince anybody a street full of eyewitnesses swore they saw sirius murder pettigrew i myself gave evidence to the ministry that sirius had been the potters secretkeeper professor lupin can tell you harry said unable to stop himself professor lupin is currently deep in the forest unable to tell anyone anything by the time he is human again it will be too late sirius will be worse than dead i might add that werewolves are so mistrusted by most of our kind that his support will count for very little and the fact that he and sirius are old friends but listen to me harry it is too late you understand me you must see that professor snapes version of events is far more convincing than yours he hates sirius hermione said desperately all because of some stupid trick sirius played on him sirius has not acted like an innocent man the attack on the fat lady entering gryffindor tower with a knife without pettigrew alive or dead we have no chance of overturning siriuss sentence but you believe us yes i do said dumbledore quietly but i have no power to make other men see the truth or to overrule the minister of magic harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground beneath him were falling sharply away he had grown used to the idea that dumbledore could solve anything he had expected dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air but no their last hope was gone what we need said dumbledore slowly and his light blue eyes moved from harry to hermione is more time but hermione began and then her eyes became very round oh now pay attention said dumbledore speaking very low and very clearly sirius is locked in professor flitwicks office on the seventh floor thirteenth window from the right of the west tower if all goes well you will be able to save more than one innocent life tonight but remember this both of you you must not be seen miss granger you know the law you know what is at stake you must not be seen harry didnt have a clue what was going on dumbledore had turned on his heel and looked back as he reached the door i am going to lock you in it is he consulted his watch five minutes to midnight miss granger three turns should do it good luck good luck harry repeated as the door closed behind dumbledore three turns whats he talking about what are we supposed to do but hermione was fumbling with the neck of her robes pulling from beneath them a very long very fine gold chain harry come here she said urgently quick harry moved toward her completely bewildered she was holding the chain out he saw a tiny sparkling hourglass hanging from it here she had thrown the chain around his neck too ready she said breathlessly what are we doing harry said completely lost hermione turned the hourglass over three times the dark ward dissolved harry had the sensation that he was flying very fast backward a blur of colors and shapes rushed past him his ears were pounding he tried to yell but couldnt hear his own voice and then he felt solid ground beneath his feet and everything came into focus again he was standing next to hermione in the deserted entrance hall and a stream of golden sunlight was falling across the paved floor from the open front doors he looked wildly around at hermione the chain of the hourglass cutting into his neck hermione what in here hermione seized harrys arm and dragged him across the hall to the door of a broom closet she opened it pushed him inside among the buckets and mops then slammed the door behind them what how hermione what happened weve gone back in time hermione whispered lifting the chain off harrys neck in the darkness three hours back harry found his own leg and gave it a very hard pinch it hurt a lot which seemed to rule out the possibility that he was having a very bizarre dream but shh listen someones coming i think i think it might be us hermione had her ear pressed against the cupboard door footsteps across the hall yes i think its us going down to hagrids are you telling me harry whispered that were here in this cupboard and were out there too yes said hermione her ear still glued to the cupboard door im sure its us it doesnt sound like more than three people and were walking slowly because were under the invisibility cloak she broke off still listening intently weve gone down the front steps hermione sat down on an upturned bucket looking desperately anxious but harry wanted a few questions answered where did you get that hourglass thing its called a timeturner hermione whispered and i got it from professor mcgonagall on our first day back ive been using it all year to get to all my lessons professor mcgonagall made me swear i wouldnt tell anyone she had to write all sorts of letters to the ministry of magic so i could have one she had to tell them that i was a model student and that id never ever use it for anything except my studies ive been turning it back so i could do hours over again thats how ive been doing several lessons at once see but harry i dont understand what dumbledore wants us to do why did he tell us to go back three hours hows that going to help sirius harry stared at her shadowy face there must be something that happened around now he wants us to change he said slowly what happened we were walking down to hagrids three hours ago this is three hours ago and we are walking down to hagrids said hermione we just heard ourselves leaving harry frowned he felt as though he were screwing up his whole brain in concentration dumbledore just said just said we could save more than one innocent life and then it hit him hermione were going to save buckbeak but how will that help sirius dumbledore said he just told us where the window is the window of flitwicks office where theyve got sirius locked up weve got to fly buckbeak up to the window and rescue sirius sirius can escape on buckbeak they can escape together from what harry could see of hermiones face she looked terrified if we manage that without being seen itll be a miracle well weve got to try havent we said harry he stood up and pressed his ear against the door doesnt sound like anyones there come on lets go harry pushed open the closet door the entrance hall was deserted as quietly and quickly as they could they darted out of the closet and down the stone steps the shadows were already lengthening the tops of the trees in the forbidden forest gilded once more with gold if anyones looking out of the window hermione squeaked looking up at the castle behind them well run for it said harry determinedly straight into the forest all right well have to hide behind a tree or something and keep a lookout okay but well go around by the greenhouses said hermione breathlessly we need to keep out of sight of hagrids front door or well see us we must be nearly at hagrids by now still working out what she meant harry set off at a sprint hermione behind him they tore across the vegetable gardens to the greenhouses paused for a moment behind them then set off again fast as they could skirting around the whomping willow tearing toward the shelter of the forest safe in the shadows of the trees harry turned around seconds later hermione arrived beside him panting right she gasped we need to sneak over to hagrids keep out of sight harry they made their way silently through the trees keeping to the very edge of the forest then as they glimpsed the front of hagrids house they heard a knock upon his door they moved quickly behind a wide oak trunk and peered out from either side hagrid had appeared in his doorway shaking and white looking around to see who had knocked and harry heard his own voice its us were wearing the invisibility cloak let us in and we can take it off yeh shouldnve come hagrid whispered he stood back then shut the door quickly this is the weirdest thing weve ever done harry said fervently lets move along a bit hermione whispered we need to get nearer to buckbeak they crept through the trees until they saw the nervous hippogriff tethered to the fence around hagrids pumpkin patch now harry whispered no said hermione if we steal him now those committee people will think hagrid set him free weve got to wait until theyve seen hes tied outside thats going to give us about sixty seconds said harry this was starting to seem impossible at that moment there was a crash of breaking china from inside hagrids cabin thats hagrid breaking the milk jug hermione whispered im going to find scabbers in a moment sure enough a few minutes later they heard hermiones shriek of surprise hermione said harry suddenly what if we we just run in there and grab pettigrew no said hermione in a terrified whisper dont you understand were breaking one of the most important wizarding laws nobodys supposed to change time nobody you heard dumbledore if were seen wed only be seen by ourselves and hagrid harry what do you think youd do if you saw yourself bursting into hagrids house said hermione id id think id gone mad said harry or id think there was some dark magic going on exactly you wouldnt understand you might even attack yourself dont you see professor mcgonagall told me what awful things have happened when wizards have meddled with time loads of them ended up killing their past or future selves by mistake okay said harry it was just an idea i just thought but hermione nudged him and pointed toward the castle harry moved his head a few inches to get a clear view of the distant front doors dumbledore fudge the old committee member and macnair the executioner were coming down the steps were about to come out hermione breathed and sure enough moments later hagrids back door opened and harry saw himself ron and hermione walking out of it with hagrid it was without a doubt the strangest sensation of his life standing behind the tree and watching himself in the pumpkin patch its okay beaky its okay hagrid said to buckbeak then he turned to harry ron and hermione go on get goin hagrid we cant well tell them what really happened they cant kill him go its bad enough without you lot in trouble an all harry watched the hermione in the pumpkin patch throw the invisibility cloak over him and ron go quick don listen there was a knock on hagrids front door the execution party had arrived hagrid turned around and headed back into his cabin leaving the back door ajar harry watched the grass flatten in patches all around the cabin and heard three pairs of feet retreating he ron and hermione had gone but the harry and hermione hidden in the trees could now hear what was happening inside the cabin through the back door where is the beast came the cold voice of macnair out outside hagrid croaked harry pulled his head out of sight as macnairs face appeared at hagrids window staring out at buckbeak then they heard fudge we er have to read you the official notice of execution hagrid ill make it quick and then you and macnair need to sign it macnair youre supposed to listen too thats procedure macnairs face vanished from the window it was now or never wait here harry whispered to hermione ill do it as fudges voice started again harry darted out from behind his tree vaulted the fence into the pumpkin patch and approached buckbeak it is the decision of the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures that the hippogriff buckbeak hereafter called the condemned shall he executed on the sixth of june at sundown careful not to blink harry stared up into buckbeaks fierce orange eyes once more and bowed buckbeak sank to his scaly knees and then stood up again harry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying buckbeak to the fence sentenced to execution by beheading to be carried out by the committees appointed executioner walden macnair come on buckbeak harry murmured come on were going to help you quietly quietly as witnessed below hagrid you sign here harry threw all his weight onto the rope but buckbeak had dug in his front feet well lets get this over with said the reedy voice of the committee member from inside hagrids cabin hagrid perhaps it will be better if you stay inside no i i wan ter be with him i don wan him ter be alone footsteps echoed from within the cabin buckbeak move harry hissed harry tugged harder on the rope around buckbeaks neck the hippogriff began to walk rustling its wings irritably they were still ten feet away from the forest in plain view of hagrids back door one moment please macnair came dumbledores voice you need to sign too the footsteps stopped harry heaved on the rope buckbeak snapped his beak and walked a little faster hermiones white face was sticking out from behind a tree harry hurry she mouthed harry could still hear dumbledores voice talking from within the cabin he gave the rope another wrench buckbeak broke into a grudging trot they had reached the trees quick quick hermione moaned darting out from behind her tree seizing the rope too and adding her weight to make buckbeak move faster harry looked over his shoulder they were now blocked from sight they couldnt see hagrids garden at all stop he whispered to hermione they might hear us hagrids back door had opened with a bang harry hermione and buckbeak stood quite still even the hippogriff seemed to be listening intently silence then where is it said the reedy voice of the committee member where is the beast it was tied here said the executioner furiously i saw it just here how extraordinary said dumbledore there was a note of amusement in his voice beaky said hagrid huskily there was a swishing noise and the thud of an axe the executioner seemed to have swung it into the fence in anger and then came the howling and this time they could hear hagrids words through his sobs gone gone bless his little beak hes gone musta pulled himself free beaky yeh clever boy buckbeak started to strain against the rope trying to get back to hagrid harry and hermione tightened their grip and dug their heels into the forest floor to stop him someone untied him the executioner was snarling we should search the grounds the forest macnair if buckbeak has indeed been stolen do you really think the thief will have led him away on foot said dumbledore still sounding amused search the skies if you will hagrid i could do with a cup of tea or a large brandy o o course professor said hagrid who sounded weak with happiness come in come in harry and hermione listened closely they heard footsteps the soft cursing of the executioner the snap of the door and then silence once more now what whispered harry looking around well have to hide in here said hermione who looked very shaken we need to wait until theyve gone back to the castle then we wait until its safe to fly buckbeak up to siriuss window he wont be there for another couple of hours oh this is going to be difficult she looked nervously over her shoulder into the depths of the forest the sun was setting now were going to have to move said harry thinking hard weve got to be able to see the whomping willow or we wont know whats going on okay said hermione getting a firmer grip on buckbeaks rope but weve got to keep out of sight harry remember they moved around the edge of the forest darkness falling thickly around them until they were hidden behind a clump of trees through which they could make out the willow theres ron said harry suddenly a dark figure was sprinting across the lawn and its shout echoed through the still night air get away from him get away scabbers come here and then they saw two more figures materialize out of nowhere harry watched himself and hermione chasing after ron then he saw ron dive gotcha get off you stinking cat theres sirius said harry the great shape of the dog had bounded out from the roots of the willow they saw him bowl harry over then seize ron looks even worse from here doesnt it said harry watching the dog pulling ron into the roots ouch look i just got walloped by the tree and so did you this is weird the whomping willow was creaking and lashing out with its lower branches they could see themselves darting here and there trying to reach the trunk and then the tree froze that was crookshanks pressing the knot said hermione and there we go harry muttered were in the moment they disappeared the tree began to move again seconds later they heard footsteps quite close by dumbledore macnair fudge and the old committee member were making their way up to the castle right after wed gone down into the passage said hermione if only dumbledore had come with us macnair and fudge wouldve come too said harry bitterly i bet you anything fudge wouldve told macnair to murder sirius on the spot they watched the four men climb the castle steps and disappear from view for a few minutes the scene was deserted then here comes lupin said harry as they saw another figure sprinting down the stone steps and halting toward the willow harry looked up at the sky clouds were obscuring the moon completely they watched lupin seize a broken branch from the ground and prod the knot on the trunk the tree stopped fighting and lupin too disappeared into the gap in its roots if hed only grabbed the cloak said harry its just lying there he turned to hermione if i just dashed out now and grabbed it snaped never be able to get it and harry we mustnt be seen how can you stand this he asked hermione fiercely just standing here and watching it happen he hesitated im going to grab the cloak harry no hermione seized the back of harrys robes not a moment too soon just then they heard a burst of song it was hagrid making his way up to the castle singing at the top of his voice and weaving slightly as he walked a large bottle was swinging from his hands see hermione whispered see what would have happened weve got to keep out of sight no buckbeak the hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to hagrid again harry seized his rope too straining to hold buckbeak back they watched hagrid meander tipsily up to the castle he was gone buckbeak stopped fighting to get away his head drooped sadly barely two minutes later the castle doors flew open yet again and snape came charging out of them running toward the willow harrys fists clenched as they watched snape skid to a halt next to the tree looking around he grabbed the cloak and held it up get your filthy hands off it harry snarled under his breath shh snape seized the branch lupin had used to freeze the tree prodded the knot and vanished from view as he put on the cloak so thats it said hermione quietly were all down there and now weve just got to wait until we come back up again she took the end of buckbeaks rope and tied it securely around the nearest tree then sat down on the dry ground arms around her knees harry theres something i dont understand why didnt the dementors get sirius i remember them coming and then i think i passed out there were so many of them harry sat down too he explained what hed seen how as the nearest dementor had lowered its mouth to harrys a large silver something had come galloping across the lake and forced the dementors to retreat hermiones mouth was slightly open by the time harry had finished but what was it theres only one thing it could have been to make the dementors go said harry a real patronus a powerful one but who conjured it harry didnt say anything he was thinking back to the person hed seen on the other bank of the lake he knew who he thought it had been but how could it have been didnt you see what they looked like said hermione eagerly was it one of the teachers no said harry he wasnt a teacher but it must have been a really powerful wizard to drive all those dementors away if the patronus was shining so brightly didnt it light him up couldnt you see yeah i saw him said harry slowly but maybe i imagined it i wasnt thinking straight i passed out right afterward who did you think it was i think harry swallowed knowing how strange this was going to sound i think it was my dad harry glanced up at hermione and saw that her mouth was fully open now she was gazing at him with a mixture of alarm and pity harry your dads well dead she said quietly i know that said harry quickly you think you saw his ghost i dont know no he looked solid but then maybe i was seeing things said harry but from what i could see it looked like him ive got photos of him hermione was still looking at him as though worried about his sanity i know it sounds crazy said harry flatly he turned to look at buckbeak who was digging his beak into the ground apparently searching for worms but he wasnt really watching buckbeak he was thinking about his father and about his fathers three oldest friends moony wormtail padfoot and prongs had all four of them been out on the grounds tonight wormtail had reappeared this evening when everyone had thought he was dead was it so impossible his father had done the same had he been seeing things across the lake the figure had been too far away to see distinctly yet he had felt sure for a moment before hed lost consciousness the leaves overhead rustled faintly in the breeze the moon drifted in and out of sight behind the shifting clouds hermione sat with her face turned toward the willow waiting and then at last after over an hour here we come hermione whispered she and harry got to their feet buckbeak raised his head they saw lupin ron and pettigrew clambering awkwardly out of the hole in the roots then came hermione then the unconscious snape drifting weirdly upward next came harry and black they all began to walk toward the castle harrys heart was starting to beat very fast he glanced up at the sky any moment now that cloud was going to move aside and show the moon harry hermione muttered as though she knew exactly what he was thinking weve got to stay put we mustnt be seen theres nothing we can do so were just going to let pettigrew escape all over again said harry quietly how do you expect to find a rat in the dark snapped hermione theres nothing we can do we came back to help sirius were not supposed to be doing anything else all right the moon slid out from behind its cloud they saw the tiny figures across the grounds stop then they saw movement there goes lupin hermione whispered hes transforming hermione said harry suddenly weve got to move we mustnt i keep telling you not to interfere lupins going to run into the forest right at us hermione gasped quick she moaned dashing to untie buckbeak quick where are we going to go where are we going to hide the dementors wilt be coming any moment back to hagrids harry said its empty now come on they ran as fast as they could buckbeak cantering along behind them they could hear the werewolf howling behind them the cabin was in sight harry skidded to the door wrenched it open and hermione and buckbeak flashed past him harry threw himself in after them and bolted the door fang the boarhound barked loudly shh fang its us said hermione hurrying over and scratching his ears to quieten him that was really close she said to harry yeah harry was looking out of the window it was much harder to see what was going on from here buckbeak seemed very happy to find himself back inside hagrids house he lay down in front of the fire folded his wings contentedly and seemed ready for a good nap i think id better go outside again you know said harry slowly i cant see whats going on we wont know when its time hermione looked up her expression was suspicious im not going to try and interfere said harry quickly but if we dont see whats going on howre we going to know when its time to rescue sirius well okay then ill wait here with buckbeak but harry be careful theres a werewolf out there and the dementors harry stepped outside again and edged around the cabin he could hear yelping in the distance that meant the dementors were closing in on sirius he and hermione would be running to him any moment harry stared out toward the lake his heart doing a kind of drumroll in his chest whoever had sent that patronus would be appearing at any moment for a fraction of a second he stood irresolute in front of hagrids door you must not be seen but he didnt want to be seen he wanted to do the seeing he had to know and there were the dementors they were emerging out of the darkness from every direction gliding around the edges of the lake they were moving away from where harry stood to the opposite bank he wouldnt have to get near them harry began to run he had no thought in his head except his father if it was him if it really was him he had to know had to find out the lake was coming nearer and nearer but there was no sign of anybody on the opposite bank he could see tiny glimmers of silver his own attempts at a patronus there was a bush at the very edge of the water harry threw himself behind it peering desperately through the leaves on the opposite bank the glimmers of silver were suddenly extinguished a terrified excitement shot through him any moment now come on he muttered staring about where are you dad come on but no one came harry raised his head to look at the circle of dementors across the lake one of them was lowering its hood it was time for the rescuer to appear but no one was coming to help this time and then it hit him he understood he hadnt seen his father he had seen himself harry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his wand expecto patronum he yelled and out of the end of his wand burst not a shapeless cloud of mist but a blinding dazzling silver animal he screwed up his eyes trying to see what it was it looked like a horse it was galloping silently away from him across the black surface of the lake he saw it lower its head and charge at the swarming dementors now it was galloping around and around the black shapes on the ground and the dementors were falling back scattering retreating into the darkness they were gone the patronus turned it was cantering back toward harry across the still surface of the water it wasnt a horse it wasnt a unicorn either it was a stag it was shining brightly as the moon above it was coming back to him it stopped on the bank its hooves made no mark on the soft ground as it stared at harry with its large silver eyes slowly it bowed its antlered head and harry realized prongs he whispered but as his trembling fingertips stretched toward the creature it vanished harry stood there hand still outstretched then with a great leap of his heart he heard hooves behind him he whirled around and saw hermione dashing toward him dragging buckbeak behind her what did you do she said fiercely you said you were only going to keep a lookout i just saved all our lives said harry get behind here behind this bush ill explain hermione listened to what had just happened with her mouth open yet again did anyone see you yes havent you been listening i saw me but i thought i was my dad its okay harry i cant believe it you conjured up a patronus that drove away all those dementors thats very very advanced magic i knew i could do it this time said harry because id already done it does that make sense i dont know harry look at snape together they peered around the bush at the other bank snape had regained consciousness he was conjuring stretchers and lifting the limp forms of harry hermione and black onto them a fourth stretcher no doubt bearing ron was already floating at his side then wand held out in front of him he moved them away toward the castle right its nearly time said hermione tensely looking at her watch weve got about fortyfive minutes until dumbledore locks the door to the hospital wing weve got to rescue sirius and get back into the ward before anybody realizes were missing they waited watching the moving clouds reflected in the lake while the bush next to them whispered in the breeze buckbeak bored was ferreting for worms again d you reckon hes up there yet said harry checking his watch he looked up at the castle and began counting the windows to the right of the west tower look hermione whispered whos that someones coming back out of the castle harry stared through the darkness the man was hurrying across the grounds toward one of the entrances something shiny glinted in his belt macnair said harry the executioner hes gone to get the dementors this is it hermione hermione put her hands on buckbeaks back and harry gave her a leg up then he placed his foot on one of the lower branches of the bush and climbed up in front of her he pulled buckbeaks rope back over his neck and tied it to the other side of his collar like reins ready he whispered to hermione youd better hold on to me he nudged buckbeaks sides with his heels buckbeak soared straight into the dark air harry gripped his flanks with his knees feeling the great wings rising powerfully beneath them hermione was holding harry very tight around the waist he could hear her muttering oh no i dont like this oh i really dont like this harry urged buckbeak forward they were gliding quietly toward the upper floors of the castle harry pulled hard on the lefthand side of the rope and buckbeak turned harry was trying to count the windows flashing past whoa he said pulling backward as hard as he could buckbeak slowed down and they found themselves at a stop unless you counted the fact that they kept rising up and down several feet as the hippogriff beat his wings to remain airborne hes there harry said spotting sirius as they rose up beside the window he reached out and as buckbeaks wings fell was able to tap sharply on the glass black looked up harry saw his jaw drop he leapt from his chair hurried to the window and tried to open it but it was locked stand back hermione called to him and she took out her wand still gripping the back of harrys robes with her left hand alohomora the window sprang open how how said black weakly staring at the hippogriff get on theres not much time said harry gripping buckbeak firmly on either side of his sleek neck to hold him steady youve got to get out of here the dementors are coming macnairs gone to get them black placed a hand on either side of the window frame and heaved his head and shoulders out of it it was very lucky he was so thin in seconds he had managed to fling one leg over buckbeaks back and pull himself onto the hippogriff behind hermione okay buckbeak up said harry shaking the rope up to the tower come on the hippogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and they were soaring upward again high as the top of the west tower buckbeak landed with a clatter on the battlements and harry and hermione slid off him at once sirius youd better go quick harry panted theyll reach flitwicks office any moment theyll find out youre gone buckbeak pawed the ground tossing his sharp head what happened to the other boy ron croaked sirius hes going to be okay hes still out of it but madam pomfrey says shell be able to make him better quick go but black was still staring down at harry how can i ever thank go harry and hermione shouted together black wheeled buckbeak around facing the open sky well see each other again he said you are truly your fathers son harry he squeezed buckbeaks sides with his heels harry and hermione jumped back as the enormous wings rose once more the hippogriff took off into the air he and his rider became smaller and smaller as harry gazed after them then a cloud drifted across the moon they were gone chapter twentytwo owl post again harry hermione was tugging at his sleeve staring at her watch weve got exactly ten minutes to get back down to the hospital wing without anybody seeing us before dumbledore locks the door okay said harry wrenching his gaze from the sky lets go they slipped through the doorway behind them and down a tightly spiraling stone staircase as they reached the bottom of it they heard voices they flattened themselves against the wall and listened it sounded like fudge and snape they were walking quickly along the corridor at the foot of the staircase only hope dumbledores not going to make difficulties snape was saying the kiss will be performed immediately as soon as macnair returns with the dementors this whole black affair has been highly embarrassing i cant tell you how much im looking forward to informing the daily prophet that weve got him at last i daresay theyll want to interview you snape and once young harrys back in his right mind i expect hell want to tell the prophet exactly how you saved him harry clenched his teeth he caught a glimpse of snapes smirk as he and fudge passed harry and hermiones hiding place their footsteps died away harry and hermione waited a few moments to make sure theyd really gone then started to run in the opposite direction down one staircase then another along a new corridor then they heard a cackling ahead peeves harry muttered grabbing hermiones wrist in here they tore into a deserted classroom to their left just in time peeves seemed to be bouncing along the corridor in boisterous good spirits laughing his head off oh hes horrible whispered hermione her ear to the door i bet hes all excited because the dementors are going to finish off sirius she checked her watch three minutes harry they waited until peevess gloating voice had faded into the distance then slid back out of the room and broke into a run again hermione whatll happen if we dont get back inside before dumbledore locks the door harry panted i dont want to think about it hermione moaned checking her watch again one minute they had reached the end of the corridor with the hospital wing entrance okay i can hear dumbledore said hermione tensely come on harry they crept along the corridor the door opened dumbledores back appeared i am going to lock you in they heard him saying it is five minutes to midnight miss granger three turns should do it good luck dumbledore backed out of the room closed the door and took out his wand to magically lock it panicking harry and hermione ran forward dumbledore looked up and a wide smile appeared under the long silver mustache well he said quietly we did it said harry breathlessly sirius has gone on buckbeak dumbledore beamed at them well done i think he listened intently for any sound within the hospital wing yes i think youve gone too get inside ill lock you in harry and hermione slipped back inside the dormitory it was empty except for ron who was still lying motionless in the end bed as the lock clicked behind them harry and hermione crept back to their own beds hermione tucking the timeturner back under her robes a moment later madam pomfrey came striding back out of her office did i hear the headmaster leaving am i allowed to look after my patients now she was in a very bad mood harry and hermione thought it best to accept their chocolate quietly madam pomfrey stood over them making sure they ate it but harry could hardly swallow he and hermione were waiting listening their nerves jangling and then as they both took a fourth piece of chocolate from madam pomfrey they heard a distant roar of fury echoing from somewhere above them what was that said madam pomfrey in alarm now they could hear angry voices growing louder and louder madam pomfrey was staring at the door really theyll wake everybody up what do they think theyre doing harry was trying to hear what the voices were saying they were drawing nearer he must have disapparated severus we should have left somebody in the room with him when this gets out he didnt disapparate snape roared now very close at hand you cant apparate or disapparate inside this castle this has something to do with potter severus be reasonable harry has been locked up bam the door of the hospital wing burst open fudge snape and dumbledore came striding into the ward dumbledore alone looked calm indeed he looked as though he was quite enjoying himself fudge appeared angry but snape was beside himself out with it potter he bellowed what did you do professor snape shrieked madam pomfrey control yourself see here snape be reasonable said fudge this doors been locked we just saw they helped him escape i know it snape howled pointing at harry and hermione his face was twisted spit was flying from his mouth calm down man fudge barked youre talking nonsense you dont know potter shrieked snape he did it i know he did it that will do severus said dumbledore quietly think about what you are saying this door has been locked since i left the ward ten minutes ago madam pomfrey have these students left their beds of course not said madam pomfrey bristling i would have heard them well there you have it severus said dumbledore calmly unless you are suggesting that harry and hermione are able to be in two places at once im afraid i dont see any point in troubling them further snape stood there seething staring from fudge who looked thoroughly shocked at his behavior to dumbledore whose eyes were twinkling behind his glasses snape whirled about robes swishing behind him and stormed out of the ward fellow seems quite unbalanced said fudge staring after him id watch out for him if i were you dumbledore oh hes not unbalanced said dumbledore quietly hes just suffered a severe disappointment hes not the only one puffed fudge the daily prophets going to have a field day we had black cornered and he slipped through our fingers yet again all it needs now is for the story of that hippogriffs escape to get out and ill be a laughing stock well id better go and notify the ministry and the dementors said dumbledore theyll be removed from the school i trust oh yes theyll have to go said fudge running his fingers distractedly through his hair never dreamed theyd attempt to administer the kiss on an innocent boy completely out of control no ill have them packed off back to azkaban tonight perhaps we should think about dragons at the school entrance hagrid would like that said dumbledore smiling at harry and hermione as he and fudge left the dormitory madam pomfrey hurried to the door and locked it again muttering angrily to herself she headed back to her office there was a low moan from the other end of the ward ron had woken up they could see him sitting up rubbing his head looking around what what happened he groaned harry why are we in here wheres sirius wheres lupin whats going on harry and hermione looked at each other you explain said harry helping himself to some more chocolate when harry ron and hermione left the hospital wing at noon the next day it was to find an almost deserted castle the sweltering heat and the end of the exams meant that everyone was taking full advantage of another hogsmeade visit neither ron nor hermione felt like going however so they and harry wandered onto the grounds still talking about the extraordinary events of the previous night and wondering where sirius and buckbeak were now sitting near the lake watching the giant squid waving its tentacles lazily above the water harry lost the thread of the conversation as he looked across to the opposite bank the stag had galloped toward him from there just last night a shadow fell across them and they looked tip to see a very blearyeyed hagrid mopping his sweaty face with one of his tableclothsized handkerchiefs and beaming down at them know i shouldn feel happy after wha happened las night he said i mean black escapin again an everythin but guess what what they said pretending to look curious beaky he escaped hes free bin celebratin all night thats wonderful said hermione giving ron a reproving look because he looked as though he was close to laughing yeah cantve tied him up properly said hagrid gazing happily out over the grounds i was worried this mornin mind thought he mighta met professor lupin on the grounds but lupin says he never ate anythin las night what said harry quickly blimey haven yeh heard said hagrid his smile fading a little he lowered his voice even though there was nobody in sight er snape told all the slytherins this mornin thought everyoned know by now professor lupins a werewolf see an he was loose on the grounds las night hes packin now o course hes packing said harry alarmed why leavin isn he said hagrid looking surprised that harry had to ask resigned firs thing this mornin says he cant risk it happenin again harry scrambled to his feet im going to see him he said to ron and hermione but if hes resigned doesnt sound like theres anything we can do i dont care i still want to see him ill meet you back here lupins office door was open he had already packed most of his things the grindylows empty tank stood next to his battered old suitcase which was open and nearly full lupin was bending over something on his desk and looked up only when harry knocked on the door i saw you coming said lupin smiling he pointed to the parchment he had been poring over it was the marauders map i just saw hagrid said harry and he said youd resigned its not true is it im afraid it is said lupin he started opening his desk drawers and taking out the contents why said harry the ministry of magic dont think you were helping sirius do they lupin crossed to the door and closed it behind harry no professor dumbledore managed to convince fudge that i was trying to save your lives he sighed that was the final straw for severus i think the loss of the order of merlin hit him hard so he er accidentally let slip that i am a werewolf this morning at breakfast youre not leaving just because of that said harry lupin smiled wryly this time tomorrow the owls will start arriving from parents they will not want a werewolf teaching their children harry and after last night i see their point i could have bitten any of you that must never happen again youre the best defense against the dark arts teacher weve ever had said harry dont go lupin shook his head and didnt speak he carried on emptying his drawers then while harry was trying to think of a good argument to make him stay lupin said from what the headmaster told me this morning you saved a lot of lives last night harry if im proud of anything ive done this year its how much youve learned tell me about your patronus how dyou know about that said harry distracted what else could have driven the dementors back harry told lupin what had happened when hed finished lupin was smiling again yes your father was always a stag when he transformed he said you guessed right thats why we called him prongs lupin threw his last few books into his case closed the desk drawers and turned to look at harry here i brought this from the shrieking shack last night he said handing harry back the invisibility cloak and he hesitated then held out the marauders map too i am no longer your teacher so i dont feel guilty about giving you back this as well its no use to me and i daresay you ron and hermione will find uses for it harry took the map and grinned you told me moony wormtail padfoot and prongs wouldve wanted to lure me out of school you said theyd have thought it was funny and so we would have said lupin now reaching down to close his case i have no hesitation in saying that james would have been highly disappointed if his son had never found any of the secret passages out of the castle there was a knock on the door harry hastily stuffed the marauders map and the invisibility cloak into his pocket it was professor dumbledore he didnt look surprised to see harry there your carriage is at the gates remus he said thank you headmaster lupin picked up his old suitcase and the empty grindylow tank well goodbye harry he said smiling it has been a real pleasure teaching you i feel sure well meet again sometime headmaster there is no need to see me to the gates i can manage harry had the impression that lupin wanted to leave as quickly as possible goodbye then remus said dumbledore soberly lupin shifted the grindylow tank slightly so that he and dumbledore could shake hands then with a final nod to harry and a swift smile lupin left the office harry sat down in his vacated chair staring glumly at the floor he heard the door close and looked up dumbledore was still there why so miserable harry he said quietly you should be very proud of yourself after last night it didnt make any difference said harry bitterly pettigrew got away didnt make any difference said dumbledore quietly it made all the difference in the world harry you helped uncover the truth you saved an innocent man from a terrible fate terrible something stirred in harrys memory greater and more terrible than ever before professor trelawneys prediction professor dumbledore yesterday when i was having my divination exam professor trelawney went very very strange indeed said dumbledore er stranger than usual you mean yes her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled and she said she said voldemorts servant was going to set out to return to him before midnight she said the servant would help him come back to power harry stared up at dumbledore and then she sort of became normal again and she couldnt remember anything shed said was it was she making a real prediction dumbledore looked mildly impressed do you know harry i think she might have been he said thoughtfully whod have thought it that brings her total of real predictions up to two i should offer her a pay raise but harry looked at him aghast how could dumbledore take this so calmly but i stopped sirius and professor lupin from killing pettigrew that makes it my fault if voldemort comes back it does not said dumbledore quietly hasnt your experience with the timeturner taught you anything harry the consequences of our actions are always so complicated so diverse that predicting the future is a very difficult business indeed professor trelawney bless her is living proof of that you did a very noble thing in saving pettigrews life but if he helps voldemort back to power pettigrew owes his life to you you have sent voldemort a deputy who is in your debt when one wizard saves another wizards life it creates a certain bond between them and im much mistaken if voldemort wants his servant in the debt of harry potter i dont want a connection with pettigrew said harry he betrayed my parents this is magic at its deepest its most impenetrable harry but trust me the time may come when you will be very glad you saved pettigrews life harry couldnt imagine when that would be dumbledore looked as though he knew what harry was thinking i knew your father very well both at hogwarts and later harry he said gently he would have saved pettigrew too i am sure of it harry looked up at him dumbledore wouldnt laugh he could tell dumbledore i thought it was my dad whod conjured my patronus i mean when i saw myself across the lake i thought i was seeing him an easy mistake to make said dumbledore softly i expect youll tire of hearing it but you do look extraordinarily like james except for the eyes you have your mothers eyes harry shook his head it was stupid thinking it was him he muttered i mean i knew he was dead you think the dead we loved ever truly leave us you think that we dont recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble your father is alive in you harry and shows himself most plainly when you have need of him how else could you produce that particular patronus prongs rode again last night it took a moment for harry to realize what dumblefore had said last night sirius told me all about how they became animagi said dumbledore smiling an extraordinary achievement not least keeping it quiet from me and then i remembered the most unusual form your patronus took when it charged mr malfoy down at your quidditch match against ravenclaw you know harry in a way you did see your father last night you found him inside yourself and dumbledore left the office leaving harry to his very confused thoughts nobody at hogwarts now knew the truth of what had happened the night that sirius buckbeak and pettigrew had vanished except harry ron hermione and professor dumbledore as the end of term approached harry heard many different theories about what had really happened but none of them came close to the truth malfoy was furious about buckbeak he was convinced that hagrid had found a way of smuggling the hippogriff to safety and seemed outraged that he and his father had been outwitted by a gamekeeper percy weasley meanwhile had much to say on the subject of siriuss escape if i manage to get into the ministry ill have a lot of proposals to make about magical law enforcement he told the only person who would listen his girlfriend penelope though the weather was perfect though the atmosphere was so cheerful though he knew they had achieved the near impossible in helping sirius to freedom harry had never approached the end of a school year in worse spirits he certainly wasnt the only one who was sorry to see professor lupin go the whole of harrys defense against the dark arts class was miserable about his resignation wonder what theyll give us next year said seamus finnigan gloomily maybe a vampire suggested dean thomas hopefully it wasnt only professor lupins departure that was weighing on harrys mind he couldnt help thinking a lot about professor trelawneys prediction he kept wondering where pettigrew was now whether he had sought sanctuary with voldemort yet but the thing that was lowering harrys spirits most of all was the prospect of returning to the dursleys for maybe half an hour a glorious half hour he had believed he would be living with sirius from now on his parents best friend it would have been the next best thing to having his own father back and while no news of sirius was definitely good news because it meant he had successfully gone into hiding harry couldnt help feeling miserable when he thought of the home he might have had and the fact that it was now impossible the exam results came out on the last day of term harry ron and hermione had passed every subject harry was amazed that he had got through potions he had a shrewd suspicion that dumbledore might have stepped in to stop snape failing him on purpose snapes behavior toward harry over the past week had been quite alarming harry wouldnt have thought it possible that snapes dislike for him could increase but it certainly had a muscle twitched unpleasantly at the corner of snapes thin mouth every time he looked at harry and he was constantly flexing his fingers as though itching to place them around harrys throat percy had got his topgrade newts fred and george had scraped a handful of owls each gryffindor house meanwhile largely thanks to their spectacular performance in the quidditch cup had won the house championship for the third year running this meant that the end of term feast took place amid decorations of scarlet and gold and that the gryffindor table was the noisiest of the lot as everybody celebrated even harry managed to forget about the journey back to the dursleys the next day as he ate drank talked and laughed with the rest as the hogwarts express pulled out of the station the next morning hermione gave harry and ron some surprising news i went to see professor mcgonagall this morning just before breakfast ive decided to drop muggle studies but you passed your exam with three hundred and twenty percent said ron i know sighed hermione but i cant stand another year like this one that timeturner it was driving me mad ive handed it in without muggle studies and divination ill be able to have a normal schedule again i still cant believe you didnt tell us about it said ron grumpily were supposed to be your friends i promised i wouldnt tell anyone said hermione severely she looked around at harry who was watching hogwarts disappear from view behind a mountain two whole months before hed see it again oh cheer up harry said hermione sadly im okay said harry quickly just thinking about the holidays yeah ive been thinking about them too said ron harry youve got to come and stay with us ill fix it up with mum and dad then ill call you i know how to use a fellytone now a telephone ron said hermione honestly you should take muggle studies next year ron ignored her its the quidditch world cup this summer how about it harry come and stay and well go and see it dad can usually get tickets from work this proposal had the effect of cheering harry up a great deal yeah i bet the dursleysd be pleased to let me come especially after what i did to aunt marge feeling considerably more cheerful harry joined ron and hermione in several games of exploding snap and when the witch with the tea cart arrived he bought himself a very large lunch though nothing with chocolate in it but it was late in the afternoon before the thing that made him truly happy turned up harry said hermione suddenly peering over his shoulder whats that thing outside your window harry turned to look outside something very small and gray was bobbing in and out of sight beyond the glass he stood up for a better look and saw that it was a tiny owl carrying a letter that was much too big for it the owl was so small in fact that it kept tumbling over in the air buffeted this way and that in the trains slipstream harry quickly pulled down the window stretched out his arm and caught it it felt like a very fluffy snitch he brought it carefully inside the owl dropped its letter onto harrys seat and began zooming around their compartment apparently very pleased with itself for accomplishing its task hedwig clicked her beak with a sort of dignified disapproval crookshanks sat up in his seat following the owl with his great yellow eyes ron noticing this snatched the owl safely out of harms way harry picked up the letter it was addressed to him he ripped open the letter and shouted its from sirius what said ron and hermione excitedly read it aloud dear harry i hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle i dont know whether theyre used to owl post buckbeak and i are in hiding i wont tell you where in case this owl falls into the wrong hands i have some doubt about his reliability but he is the best i could find and he did seem eager for the job i believe the dementors are still searching for me but they havent a hope of finding me here i am planning to allow some muggles to glimpse me soon a long way from hogwarts so that the security on the castle will be lifted there is something i never got around to telling you during our brief meeting it was i who sent you the firebolt ha said hermione triumphantly see i told you it was from him yes but he hadnt jinxed it had he said ron ouch the tiny owl now hooting happily in his hand had nibbled one of his fingers in what it seemed to think was an affectionate way crookshanks took the order to the owl office for me i used your name but told them to take the gold from my own gringotts vault please consider it as thirteen birthdays worth of presents from your godfather i would also like to apologize for the fright i think i gave you that night last year when you left your uncles house i had only hoped to get a glimpse of you before starting my journey north but i think the sight of me alarmed you i am enclosing something else for you which i think will make your next year at hogwarts more enjoyable if ever you need me send word your owl will find me ill write again soon sirius harry looked eagerly inside the envelope there was another piece of parchment in there he read it through quickly and felt suddenly as warm and contented as though hed swallowed a bottle of hot butterbeer in one gulp i sirius black harry potters godfather hereby give him permission to visit hogsmeade on weekends thatll be good enough for dumbledore said harry happily he looked back at siriuss letter hang on theres a ps i thought your friend ron might like to keep this owl as its my fault he no longer has a rat rons eyes widened the minute owl was still hooting excitedly keep him he said uncertainly he looked closely at the owl for a moment then to harrys and hermiones great surprise he held him out for crookshanks to sniff what do you reckon ron asked the cat definitely an owl crookshanks purred thats good enough for me said ron happily hes mine harry read and reread the letter from sirius all the way back into kings cross station it was still clutched tightly in his hand as he ron and hermione stepped back through the barrier of platform nine and threequarters harry spotted uncle vernon at once he was standing a good distance from mr and mrs weasley eyeing them suspiciously and when mrs weasley hugged harry in greeting his worst suspicions about them seemed confirmed ill call about the world cup ron yelled after harry as harry bid him and hermione goodbye then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and hedwigs cage toward uncle vernon who greeted him in his usual fashion whats that he snarled staring at the envelope harry was still clutching in his hand if its another form for me to sign youve got another its not said harry cheerfully its a letter from my godfather godfather sputtered uncle vernon you havent got a godfather yes i have said harry brightly he was my mum and dads best friend hes a convicted murderer but hes broken out of wizard prison and hes on the run he likes to keep in touch with me though keep up with my news check if im happy and grinning broadly at the look of horror on uncle vernons face harry set off toward the station exit hedwig rattling along in front of him for what looked like a much better summer than the last the end
