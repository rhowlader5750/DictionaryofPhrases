the rain falls in sheets across the yard another pane of glass beyond our windows would you like it warmer mr gill the house pings once twice no i say its fine the way it is thank you very much the house says just like anybody else the house likes to talk to somebody i imagined this as a great feature im an ergonomic architect i designed it denny is asleep in his room youd think at fifteen hed be too old to take a nap but hes wiped out after soccer carolyn threw dennys football out today the foam rubber football i gave him when he was four years old it was old she said falling apart he didnt want it any more i thought if he really doesnt want the football maybe he could say i tried asking but right then denny was off to soccer practice then a study session then the game now hes sleeping this is what happens when theyre in high school carolyn says i should be proud proud hes such an athlete and a scholar and i guess im a gentleman the rain comes down like liquid leaded glass the gardeners have taken the trash all the way to the curb once again its a very long way to the end of the driveway i return with half of dennys football she must have taken shears to it a lightning strike of rage flashes if she were home right now your body temperature is lower than normal mr gill the house chimes in its chimey voice ive been out in the rain i mutter would you like some soft fluffy towels the house asks i want the other half of the football ill glue it back together but i smile and grunt an assent to which the house responds outside the rain sleets down a thousand tiny sticks pattering on a thousand tin drums nah not drums its just our solar panels denny was born with hlhs thats an acronym for hypoplastic left heart syndrome hypoplastic left heart syndrome is universally fatal if left untreated even now there are babies that do not survive even with full length clone dna therapy administered inutero when at five months of pregnancy carolyn went for a highlevel ultrasound that determined denny had hlhs it seemed like the most natural thing in the world to try gene therapy the doctors explained how the heart healed itself as the baby grew it was raining that day pouring outside while we listened to the neonatal geneticist explain how the procedure worked we were so lucky she said before gene therapy babies like denny could only survive with full heart transplants she told us about a doctor that had tried baboon hearts to replace broken baby ones apparently some parents aborted babies diagnosed with hlhs id never accept that i said what carolyn snapped her hand over her swollen belly youd rather let my baby suffer i guess i hadnt thought of it that way the geneticist explained in the past babies born with this heart defect were simply left to die their hearts barely pumped blood and they would just fade away maybe that could be less humane than an abortion at least that was what we discussed on the way home it was a miracle that we had the gene therapy and that denny was born whole and totally healthy it was the best moment of my life the rain rattles the solar panels as i sort pictures on the computer denny in his baby swing denny playing with blocks i should be working but i cant focus on the recreation center today there was one of him holding the fuzzy book he got from his grandmother she was so frightened my mother when i told her about dennys heart problem she didnt understand gene therapy carolyn got on the phone and explained it to her when denny was born perfectly healthy i dont think any of us gave it much more thought my mother and denny sat for hours reading that little book pat the bunny her favorite she insisted on buying it i have it in my study in the right drawer of my desk at one past garage sale it had been another item bound for the dumpster i put the halffootball with pat the bunny denny was about three when he learned to read i sorted those pictures too they say a mans not supposed to be interested in pictures mementos the man lives his life and the woman saves it well what they say is true and what happens are sometimes two different things there was another book denny liked stan the hotdog man we read it over and over and one day denny started talking about stan it dawned on me that he was reading carolyn come here i called she came running in from the kitchen alarmed honey i think hes reading her face changed horse manure she said no really i said denny then read a whole page of stan the hotdog man in his small voice he beamed proudly up at me see i said youve read it to him so many times hes memorized it she said oh i said it was some time later when i learned that by memorizing the book denny was indeed reading by that time he was in kindergarten i sorted some more of the pictures from later years and looked pensively out at the rain denny was still sleeping i think i always hoped that my son would play football back before i met carolyn i played ball played all the way through sophomore year in college sidelined by a knee injury i guess i was a pretty good running back if a little bit underweight the guys were all into steroids back in those days there was no such thing as gene augmentation all we had were good oldfashioned workouts and protein shakes and maybe a shot in the butt for guys that were really dedicated or crazy you could blow your heart out on steroids they made you break out all over gave you erectile dysfunction made you crazy happened to a lot ofmy friends its a good thing i figured out that trap before i fell into it i guess i did try it a few times drops of rain dappled the window your heart rate has increased mr gill the house chimed your core body temperature has dropped so turn up the heat i told the house i had to say something otherwise it wouldnt leave me alone i folded the blue ribbon neatly into my desk drawer for math excellence why theyd give a math prize to a kid in second grade was beyond me when denny hit second grade his teacher pointed up that he was reading like a pro but having trouble with his figures i was never too good with math i told her wasnt that great in reading either but i didnt feel compelled to share you might want to look into some tutoring she said hes in second grade i said carolyn hushed me how far is he behind she asked behind the teacher asked oh no hes not behind well theres no reason to worry i said hell pick it up his times tables carolyn said next year hes got to learn the times tables we dont do it that way any more mrs gill each child is tested individually against his or her own standards i didnt precisely follow how there could be enough time to set individual standards seeing as the kid had just started second grade how far is he behind carolyn asked again hes not behind the teacher said a stubborn tone creeping into her voice denny is so bright im sure youd agree with me that he could do better if he applied himself thats all im trying to say maybe he just wants to play outside i said hush carolyn said gary and i both agree that denny is bright and hes got plenty of motivation well the teacher said smiling why dont you try that tutoring service or a math buddy a math buddy was like an english buddy or a foreign language buddy it was a small silver painintheass robot that could also vacuum the floor they were notorious for tripping guys foolish enough to buy them for their kids a guy in cleveland broke his neck that way i was going to be damned if id get one i would have rather gotten denny another football on the way out to the car carolyn looked up at me concern wrinkling her forehead hes falling behind in math she whispered you dont have to whisper i told her nobody can hear besides the teacher said hes not behind we can encourage him encourage him carolyn snapped he can do better and he will well do you think we should try a tutor i asked the thought of locking denny inside with some greasyhaired high school math geek made me cringe but even that was a more appealing choice than bringing a gibbering tortoiselike math buddy into the house so it could trip me on the stairs and turn me into a paraplegic no carolyn said not a tutor i felt relieved have you heard about the new gene therapy she asked its just like what they did for dennys heart defect only it can strengthen a childs brain power i was reading all about it yesterday oh i said i had pretty favorable memories of how theyd fixed dennys heart how does that work maybe its like what they did before only they inject the new genetic material into someones brain then it makes a few changes and the person gets smarter oh i said i didnt like the thought of anybody injecting anything into dennys brain but id learned it was best not to interrupt carolyn when she was thinking like this frankly it was almost always better just to wait things out half the time she forgot about this stuff and never mentioned it again if youre concerned about your sons logical and mathematical abilities i dont think youve got much to worry about with denny dr mandel said hes a bright normal boy but his teacher says hes falling behind in math carolyn said cant we do something id recommend a math buddy the doctor said my own daughter has one shes about dennys age she used to hate math and now she loves it doesnt that thing get in your way i asked about the math buddy thing the doctor said looking puzzled oh he said chuckling yeah it did trip me up once i fell right off the deck into the pool theres something i dont like about those little robots i said the teacher also suggested a tutor a wise choice the doctor said he started to check his personal assistant a sure sign our time was up i started to rise but carolyn put her hand on my arm wait she said can you explain how the procedure works doctor he paused i suddenly understood that he was one of those guys who never missed a chance to wow others with his special technical knowledge well he said smiling years ago we discovered that viruses could be effective transports to load different types of dna into human or any other type of brains now weve identified a specific enzyme or cocktail of enzymes that enhances almost every type of brain function we load the enzymes into a virus which then transcribes the dna and delivers the desired changes to what we once thought were unchangeable brain cells im sure youve heard of people building up their extrasensory perception carolyn and i nodded wed seen a show about wildeyed lunatics bending iron and starting fires at a distance the night before its like an infection dr mandel said but its one that most people wouldnt mind catching like a cold carolyn asked exactly dr mandel said you do understand only in this case the subject catches the cold in their cerebral cortex and as healing occurs so do changes for the better wow carolyn said im not sure about this i said shhh she hushed how old is your son the doctor asked seven carolyn said ah the perfect age look he said leaning across his shiny titanium desk everybody who was anybody had one of those a few years backits not cheap but you could make your son into a math genius if you wanted he wouldnt feel a thing and a few days later his abilities would manifest theyd grow day by day i dont know i said it sounded like mad scientist stuff to me werent they trying these techniques on psychotic murderers if this was so safe and healthy i figured we would have heard about it in other areas beside criminal rehabilitation and ironbending firestarters people are doing it all the time dr mandel said you just dont hear about it on the newslinks because improving kids test scores isnt nearly as big a story as turning a massmurderer into mother teresa carolyn squeezed my hand under the table doctor wed like to try she said i suppose we could dr mandel said voice slightly uncertain is this necess carolyn cut me short i know he can benefit she said i dont think we mentioned it earlier but denny received gene therapy before he was born to cure a congenital heart defect oh the doctor said in that case hes prequalified be sure to fill out all the forms you two were conducting multitreatment longitudinal studies and your son is an ideal candidate so denny got the blue ribbon in math he got so into math that he stayed inside almost all the time he hardly wanted to play with his friends any more we were supposed to start pony league football but denny didnt want to play he didnt want to try for tball either the only thing hed talk about was math one day carolyn pointed out that denny was getting a little chunky he was size eight last month she said now ive got to buy the next size up so my mom told me i grew three sizes and four inches one summer your mom said all kinds of things carolyn said mom had passed last spring we used to joke about her seeing denny through high school it wasnt meant to be could you give it a rest carolyn my wife thought that seven months was long enough for mourning she forged ahead dennys getting fat gary we cant let him get overweight so well put him on a diet i said id been a little chunky when i was his age when my mom found out how much time i could waste playing video games she ripped the whole console out of the wall it was the cold turkey video game withdrawal method i lost the weight we tried a diet but denny was too young to understand why he couldnt eat everything he liked i wasnt surprised when a couple of frustrating weeks later carolyn told me that shed called dr mandel there was of course a gene therapy the most popular one of all to deal with unwanted weight gain this time the virus carrying altered dna helped to increase some of the hormones in the brain that controlled appetite and metabolism voila a thin kid that was dennys third treatment the rain is imploding on the roof its almost in my head turn up the heat i scream the house complies if i didnt know better id almost think that the house was sulking after the obesity treatment denny started getting into soccer and discovered his talent for art by thirteen denny was dr mandels best patient he had even been featured on the cover of parenting with two other kids that had been helped by dr mandels gene practice it wasnt exactly as if gene therapy was cuttingedge any more dr mandel was known for his boutique practice that meant that he helped parents with money and fineedged concerns about their childrens growth and wellbeing no one really took the dire warnings of the early part of the millennium seriously creating a master race and soon well heck if a person could get a little bit better in some way and it wasnt hurting them or anybody else how did that qualify as a master race people without genetic improvements were never looked down upon sure it was a generational thing i mean there were some skin therapies for people my age and carolyns age and they had learned how to rejuvenate most of the vital organs when i was young it was a big deal for anybody to make it to age 100 these days you had to hit 120 and look really good to get your picture on the newslinks it was the kids that benefited if somebody would have told me back in the day that a pugsley kid could turn into a hunk in a matter of weeks or a kid with no chin could suddenly acquire a nice square one without surgery i would have laughed out loud you were what you were born to be up until he was nine or ten dennys eyes were kind of a hazel color now they were piercing bright blue the girls went crazy over his eyes i mean the kid was a goodlooking fifteen but the house chimed somebody was calling gary here i answered is denny home came a petite snippy little voice yes but hes sleeping tired out after his game i didnt share that hed had yet another treatment this one to deal with a few pimples of all things kids slept a lot after a treatment body change and metabolic readjustment supposedly dr mandel likened it to growing pains oh well like we were supposed to be studying for chemistry tonight the little voice said after a moments pause she added this is candy i thought you were apple i said she sounded like the girl denny had introduced me to named apple apple was a cheerleader and no im candy she said vehemently i dont see how you could confuse us apple is completely shallow and selfcentered and she cant pass math im the captain of the debate team oh i said of course she was debate team captain my mistake apple calls a lot oh candy said i see denny hardly ever takes her calls i said this was utterly untrue but for some reason i enjoyed the thought of the little white lie that was involved oh she said voice brightening well just tell denny that i called thank you mr gill and she broke the connection so i went upstairs hey i said waking denny a girl called denny rose shaking sleep out of his eyes yeah who was it dad apple i said wait no candy candy denny said smiling slyly she likes me i think shes the jealous type too i said what are you doing to attract all these girls denny denny scooted up in bed and swung his legs to the floor he started rubbing his shoulder hurt it a little bit in the game he said howd it go not bad he said we won by two goals i got the last goal of course you did i thought i hadnt gone to the game somehow i just hadnt wanted to it was raining i said it was crazy to play soccer in the rain watching soccer in the rain was even crazier i couldnt put my finger on the real reason i hadnt gone to the game carolyn was at work of course she had a fulfilling demanding job at the local art museum she put together their brochures and maintained their web presence everybody says what artistic talent she has its really amazing how denny has the same abilities maybe even moreso paintings drawings vector art denny does it all he would be taking sculpture if it didnt conflict with soccer practice denny got up and started to strip off his clothes he was only fifteen but his chest and biceps were more muscular than mine not just at that age now he sprinted into his bathroom and called for the house to turn on the shower did you order more aftershave dad he called yeah i said yesterday oh right denny said its all full now i can see it of course i ordered aftershave when you work from home all those little chores seem to fall on you tell the house what to cook for dinner tell it to keep the different meals ready at different times for everyones schedule see to it the laundry schedule isnt too full and somebody namely denny isnt going to have to run to a soccer game and play in a dirty jersey make sure all the plants are watered and trimmed and the rug is vacuumed and the floor polished and there are no lights out and there hey dad what should i do about candy denny asked from the shower do about what she likes me dad i like her fine as a friend but i dont want to get serious shes just not whats wrong with her nothing denny said well if theres nothing wrong with her why dont you like her i knew perfectly well what he meant but i was just playing with his mind i mean like dad as in you know youre supposed to be the genius i said i dont know so explain it to me i dont know what i expected to hear shes homely dad or she comes on too strong or maybe shes pretty nerdy shes a mundane dad denny said i just cant get interested in a girl whos never had any type of modifications i said oh i sat on the bed i think it was the way he said it denny came out of the shower a towel wrapped around his adonis like frame dad you know how it is he said yeah i said i mean look at apple she might not be that smart but shes got a great body she does a fiveminute mile and her nails are perfect i know her hairs not real but what does that matter it looks great apples a nice girl i said a long time ago when denny was a baby my mother came over and we spent the whole day playing building towers of blocks reading books setting up paper and finger paints on the kitchen table she baked cookies i watched my son and my mother playing together his hair was light brown and wispy over his hazel eyes maybe he looked like an old balding fat guy but he was just a baby there was a funny little cleft in his chin he was clumsy we worked with him to use his right hand then his left just letting him experiment she grabbed his outstretched hands in hers and lifted him up he giggled and stood and toddled then soon sat back down he was only nine months even a genetically modified baby cant walk at nine months and it comes to me why i didnt go to the game i looked in dennys eyes a long while bright blue they were theres been nobody with blue eyes in my family for a long time maybe there never were i cant say those were carolyns eyes either she has muddy brown eyes and hates them denny started to laugh feeling uncomfortable hey dad what are you looking at me like that for i cant reply im just you know i say finally i look over at dennys artwork at the trophies for soccer math ribbons his poster running for class president last year yeah he won your mom threw your little kid football out this morning i said what football denny asked it was no big deal i guess i really didnt know how to explain i heard him on the phone after dinner talking up that apple yeah baby i know its hard but everyones parents are pretty much mundanes you should see my dad it wasnt like i hadnt had my own rough spots with my dad i wanted to run in and grab the vox away from denny yell tell her to respect her parents tell him denny never knew my father carolyns dad was an old fart who painted bowls of fruit and sadeyed clowns he wasnt a bad guy he was just kind of distant there was no way to make denny comprehend that my dad had been a great guy i mean i hated dad when he grounded me i hated him when he took my car away i hated him when he flushed my sad little pot stash down the can he taught me responsibility he taught me what it meant to be a man a mundane hush my feet i told the house much later that night the house could do that you know make it quiet to walk or very noisy only the administrator could tell it to do that i know a lot of parents that use this feature i was sleeping in my study again no i was lying on the couch in the study pretending to sleep it was easier carolyn always has some book shes reading or some work shes going over and that light in my eyes drives me crazy i was turning the whole thing over in my mind all the little treatments yeah it was right to fix dennys heart we had to fix dennys heart denny was the only son carolyn and i were ever going to have i used back in the day you know stacking i was juiced up all the time i thought it made me more of a man they said it was a minor miracle that carolyn had gotten pregnant since i had a sperm count of about 3 three million particles per ml and after that it went down even more they call that sterile she could have left me maybe if i had been in her shoes i would have she could have had a lot more kids with a healthy man but this was our son this was denny one time my dad was watching me at football practice i caught a right screen pass wed been practicing a long time and raced away my legs were wings the scrimmagers hurled themselves at me in slow motion i was flying the wind whipping through the bars of my helmet nobody could touch me my dad had this look on his face when he ran out on the field after that scrimmage we didnt need to say too much in fact we didnt say anything i was his son and he was my dad then it started to rain and we headed for our car i wandered into the kitchen still remembering hey house im going to make a sandwich i whispered i want to use the last of that good bread do you want me to slice it the house asked no i said you know i cut it myself thats right the house said it put the bread and knife out on the counter mustard yes lettuce no just bologna very good the house said lowfat high protein right house i said thanks i cut the bread for the sandwich put mustard on the bread slapped down the meat slapped the whole thing together and stuffed it in my mouth then i started upstairs on quiet feet dont forget to put your knife in the dishwasher the house said to some questions house did not require an immediate answer in terms of his eyes they were blue a tear rolls down my mundane cheek his chest moves slowly up and down his breathing soft like a cat denny stirs moans slightly so they dream but what dreams come i can never know
